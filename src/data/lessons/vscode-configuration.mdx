# VS Code Configuration

Essential VS Code extensions and settings: ESLint, Prettier, and workspace setup.

## Introduction

### Making VS Code Work for You

Out of the box, VS Code is a decent text editor. But with the right extensions and settings, it becomes a powerful development environment that can catch your mistakes, format your code automatically, and make you significantly more productive.

**Real-world scenario**: Imagine you're working on a team project and everyone's code looks different - some use 2 spaces for indentation, others use 4, some put curly braces on new lines, others don't. This makes the codebase messy and hard to read. Professional teams solve this with code formatters and linters that enforce consistent style.

### What You'll Set Up Today
- **ESLint**: Catches errors and enforces coding standards
- **Prettier**: Automatically formats your code to look consistent  
- **Basic settings**: Make VS Code more comfortable for development
- **Workspace setup**: Organize your course folder properly

### Why These Tools Matter
- **ESLint** catches bugs before you run your code
- **Prettier** makes your code look professional and consistent
- **Proper setup** saves you hours of debugging and formatting time
- **Professional habits** start from day one

## Core Concept Overview

### Understanding VS Code Extensions

**What are extensions?**
- Add-on software that extends VS Code's functionality
- Like apps on your phone - each one adds specific features
- Installed from the VS Code Marketplace
- Some are essential, others are nice-to-have

**How extensions work:**
- Run inside VS Code's environment
- Can modify the editor's behavior
- Often work together (like ESLint + Prettier)
- Can be enabled/disabled per workspace

### Key Tools We're Installing

**ESLint (Linting Tool)**:
- **Purpose**: Finds problems in your JavaScript code
- **What it catches**: Syntax errors, unused variables, style violations
- **How it helps**: Red squiggly lines under problematic code
- **Real benefit**: Catches bugs before you run the program

**Prettier (Code Formatter)**:
- **Purpose**: Automatically formats code to look consistent
- **What it fixes**: Indentation, spacing, quote marks, line breaks
- **How it works**: Reformats code when you save the file
- **Real benefit**: Code looks professional without manual effort

**Built-in VS Code Features We'll Configure**:
- Auto-save functionality
- Tab settings for consistent indentation
- Integrated terminal setup
- File explorer customization

### Key Terms
- **Linting**: Analyzing code for potential errors and style issues
- **Formatting**: Changing code appearance without changing functionality
- **Workspace**: A folder opened in VS Code with its own settings
- **Extension Host**: VS Code's system for running extensions

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Open Your Course Workspace

1. **Open VS Code** (if not already open)
2. **Open your Code folder**:
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + O`, navigate to `/Users/YourName/Code`
   - **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + O`, navigate to `C:\Users\YourName\Code`
   - **Or use Terminal/Command Prompt**: Navigate to Code folder, type `code .`

3. **Create the SWIC-Course folder** (if you haven't already):
   - In VS Code's Explorer sidebar, right-click in empty space
   - Select "New Folder"  
   - Name it `SWIC-Course`
   - This is where all your course work will go

### Step 2: Install ESLint Extension

1. **Open Extensions panel**:
   - Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (looks like four squares)
   - **Or** press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac)

2. **Search for ESLint**:
   - Type "ESLint" in the search box
   - Look for the one by "Microsoft" (should be the first result)
   - It should have millions of downloads

3. **Install ESLint**:
   - Click the blue "Install" button
   - Wait for installation to complete
   - You'll see "Reload Required" or the button will change to "Installed"

4. **Verify installation**:
   - You should see ESLint in your installed extensions list
   - The extension icon should appear in your sidebar

### Step 3: Install Prettier Extension

1. **Still in Extensions panel**, search for "Prettier"
2. **Find the right one**:
   - Look for "Prettier - Code formatter" by Prettier
   - Should have many millions of downloads
   - Description mentions "code formatter"

3. **Install Prettier**:
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for installation to complete

4. **Verify both extensions**:
   - Both ESLint and Prettier should show as "Installed"
   - If VS Code prompts you to reload, click "Reload Now"

### Step 4: Configure VS Code Settings

1. **Open Settings**:
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + ,` or VS Code → Preferences → Settings
   - **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + ,` or File → Preferences → Settings

2. **Switch to JSON settings** (for precision):
   - In the Settings tab, click the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon (looks like a document with curly braces)
   - This opens `settings.json` file

3. **Add these essential settings**:
   Replace the entire contents of the file with this:
   ```json
   {
     "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
     "editor.formatOnSave": true,
     "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
       "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
     },
     "editor.tabSize": 2,
     "editor.insertSpaces": true,
     "editor.detectIndentation": false,
     "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",
     "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
     "editor.wordWrap": "on",
     "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14,
     "editor.fontSize": 14,
     "editor.lineHeight": 1.5,
     "workbench.startupEditor": "none"
   }
   ```

4. **Save the settings file**:
   - Press `Ctrl + S` (Windows) / `Cmd + S` (Mac)
   - VS Code will apply these settings immediately

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. **Create a test JavaScript file**:
   - Right-click in the SWIC-Course folder
   - Select "New File"
   - Name it `test.js`

2. **Add some intentionally messy code**:
   ```javascript
   let name="John";let age=25
   if(name=="John"){
   console.log("Hello "+name)
   console.log('You are '+age+' years old')
   }
   ```

3. **Save the file** (`Ctrl/Cmd + S`):
   - Prettier should automatically format it to look like:
   ```javascript
   let name = "John";
   let age = 25;
   if (name == "John") {
     console.log("Hello " + name);
     console.log("You are " + age + " years old");
   }
   ```

4. **Check for ESLint warnings**:
   - You should see yellow squiggly lines under some code
   - Hover over them to see suggestions like "Use === instead of =="
   - This is ESLint helping you write better code!

### Step 6: Create a Workspace Configuration

1. **Save as Workspace**:
   - File → Save Workspace As...
   - Save it in your Code folder as `SWIC-Course.code-workspace`
   - This saves your folder structure and settings

2. **Benefits of workspaces**:
   - Settings apply only to this project
   - Can have different settings for different projects
   - Easier to reopen your course work

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### ESLint vs. Prettier: What's the Difference?

| Tool | Purpose | Examples | When It Runs |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| ESLint | Find bugs and enforce coding standards | "Use `const` instead of `let`", "Missing semicolon" | As you type, shows warnings |
| Prettier | Format code appearance | Fix indentation, add/remove spaces | When you save file |

### Settings Explanation

Let's understand what each setting does:

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode", // Use Prettier for formatting
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,                         // Auto-format when saving
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {                        
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"                 // Fix ESLint issues on save
  },
  "editor.tabSize": 2,                                 // 2 spaces per indentation level
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,                         // Use spaces instead of tabs
  "editor.detectIndentation": false,                   // Don't guess indentation
  "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",                   // Save when you click elsewhere
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,                     // Hide minimap (saves space)
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",                             // Wrap long lines
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14,                  // Readable terminal text
  "editor.fontSize": 14,                               // Readable editor text  
  "editor.lineHeight": 1.5,                            // Space between lines
  "workbench.startupEditor": "none"                    // Don't show welcome tab
}
```

### Professional Development Setup

**Industry standards we're following**:
- **2-space indentation**: Standard for JavaScript/web development
- **Format on save**: Keeps code consistent automatically
- **ESLint rules**: Catches common mistakes early
- **Auto-save**: Prevents lost work

**This setup matches**:
- Google's JavaScript style guide
- Airbnb's style guide (popular in React development)
- Most professional development teams
- Major open-source projects

### Additional Useful Extensions

**After you're comfortable with basics, consider**:
- **Live Server**: Preview HTML files in browser with auto-refresh
- **Bracket Pair Colorizer**: Makes matching brackets colorful
- **GitLens**: Enhanced Git integration
- **Auto Rename Tag**: Updates HTML/JSX tag pairs automatically
- **Path Intellisense**: Autocompletes file paths

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Setup Issues

#### "Prettier isn't formatting my code"
1. **Check file type**: Make sure file has `.js`, `.html`, etc. extension
2. **Check default formatter**: Go to Settings → search "default formatter" → select Prettier
3. **Check format on save**: Settings → search "format on save" → enable it
4. **Restart VS Code**: Close and reopen VS Code

#### "ESLint isn't showing warnings"
1. **Check file extension**: ESLint only works on `.js` files by default
2. **Install ESLint globally**: In terminal, run `npm install -g eslint`
3. **Create ESLint config**: We'll do this in future lessons
4. **Restart VS Code**: Extensions sometimes need a restart

#### "Settings aren't taking effect"
1. **Check settings scope**: Make sure you're editing User settings, not Workspace
2. **JSON syntax**: Ensure your JSON is valid (no missing commas, quotes)
3. **Restart VS Code**: Some settings require restart

### Best Practices for VS Code

#### Workspace organization:
```
Code/
├── SWIC-Course/
│   ├── week-1/
│   ├── week-2/
│   └── projects/
├── Practice/
│   └── experiments/
└── SWIC-Course.code-workspace
```

#### Keep extensions minimal:
- Start with essentials (ESLint, Prettier)
- Add extensions only when you need them
- Too many extensions slow down VS Code
- Disable unused extensions per workspace

#### Learn keyboard shortcuts:
| Shortcut | Action | Why Important |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + P` | Quick file open | Navigate large projects |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` | Command palette | Access all VS Code features |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + /` | Toggle comment | Quick code commenting |
| `Alt + ↑/↓` | Move line up/down | Reorganize code quickly |

### Customizing for Your Preferences

**Theme and appearance**:
- File → Preferences → Color Theme
- Try "Dark+ (default dark)" or "Light+ (default light)"
- Don't spend too much time on themes initially

**Font preferences**:
- Consider "Fira Code" font for coding (has ligatures)
- Install separately, then add to settings:
  ```json
  "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code, Consolas, Monaco, monospace",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
  ```

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### Key Takeaways

1. **ESLint catches mistakes** before you run your code
2. **Prettier ensures consistency** without manual effort
3. **Proper settings save time** and reduce frustration
4. **Professional habits** start with proper tooling
5. **VS Code is customizable** but start simple
6. **Workspaces organize projects** and settings

### Configuration Checklist

Verify your setup by checking these items:

- [ ] ESLint extension installed and active
- [ ] Prettier extension installed and active  
- [ ] Settings.json configured with provided settings
- [ ] Format on save works (test with messy code)
- [ ] ESLint shows warnings/suggestions in JavaScript files
- [ ] Auto-save is working (file saves when you click elsewhere)
- [ ] SWIC-Course folder created and organized
- [ ] Workspace saved as .code-workspace file

### Quick Test

1. **Create a new JavaScript file** in SWIC-Course folder
2. **Type this messy code**:
   ```javascript
   let x=1;if(x==1){console.log("test")}
   ```
3. **Save the file** (`Ctrl/Cmd + S`)
4. **Verify formatting**: Code should automatically become:
   ```javascript
   let x = 1;
   if (x == 1) {
     console.log("test");
   }
   ```
5. **Check ESLint warning**: You should see a suggestion to use `===` instead of `==`

If all of this works, your setup is perfect!
