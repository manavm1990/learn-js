# Windows Setup Guide

Complete setup instructions for Windows users: VS Code, Node.js, Git, and developer tools.

## Introduction

Setting up your development environment on Windows requires downloading and installing each tool individually. While Windows has package managers like Chocolatey and WinGet, we will use direct downloads for simplicity and consistency. This guide will establish a professional development environment identical to what you would use in industry.

The following instructions are specifically for Windows users. Mac users should refer to the [Mac Setup Guide](/mac-setup-guide) instead. The entire setup process takes approximately 45 minutes depending on your internet connection speed.

**Note:** If you are an advanced Windows user and you know and understand how to use the ðŸ“¦ managers such as Chocolatey or WinGet, you may choose to use them for installation.

### What You'll Install Today

- **Visual Studio Code**: Your primary code editor
- **Node.js LTS**: JavaScript runtime for executing code outside browsers
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking code changes
- **Warp Terminal**: Modern terminal with integrated AI assistance
- **GitHub CLI**: Command-line interface for GitHub operations
- **Claude Desktop**: AI coding assistant optimized for developers

## Core Concept Overview

### Understanding Windows Development Tools

**Command Prompt and PowerShell** serve as Windows' built-in command-line interfaces. Command Prompt represents the legacy interface, while PowerShell offers more advanced capabilities. We will bootstrap with these tools initially, then transition to Warp Terminal for superior development experience.

**Visual Studio Code** functions as a powerful code editor created by Microsoft. It provides syntax highlighting for code readability, integrated terminal access, comprehensive file management, and thousands of extensions for added functionality. The editor serves as your primary workspace for writing and editing code.

**Node.js** enables JavaScript execution directly on your computer rather than exclusively in web browsers. It includes npm (Node Package Manager) for installing code libraries and packages. We install the LTS (Long Term Support) version for maximum stability.

**Git** provides version control capabilities essential for professional development. It tracks changes in your code over time, enables collaboration with other developers, and creates snapshots of your work for recovery purposes.

### Windows File System Structure

Windows organizes files through a hierarchical structure starting with drive letters. Your main drive typically appears as `C:\`, with user files stored in `C:\Users\YourName\`. Most software installs to `C:\Program Files\` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\`. We will create a dedicated `Code` folder in your user directory for organizing all development projects.

The PATH environment variable determines where Windows searches for executable programs. Many installation issues stem from incorrect PATH configuration, which installers typically handle automatically when you select the appropriate options.

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

Navigate to the VS Code website at `https://code.visualstudio.com/` using any web browser. Click the prominent "Download for Windows" button to download the installer file, which will be named something like `VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.XX.X.exe`.

Once downloaded, navigate to your Downloads folder and double-click the installer file. When Windows requests permission to make changes, click Yes. Proceed through the installation wizard, accepting the license agreement.

On the "Select Additional Tasks" screen, ensure you check all the following options: "Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer file context menu", "Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer directory context menu", "Register Code as an editor for supported file types", and "Add to PATH". These selections enable convenient VS Code access from Windows Explorer and the command line.

Complete the installation by clicking Install and waiting for the process to finish. Launch VS Code to verify successful installation. You should see the Welcome screen with a dark theme by default.

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Visit the Node.js website at `https://nodejs.org/`. You will see two download options. Select the LTS version (marked as "Recommended for Most Users") rather than the Current version. This downloads a file named like `node-v20.XX.X-x64.msi`.

Run the Node.js installer from your Downloads folder, granting Windows permission when requested. Progress through the installation wizard, accepting the license agreement and keeping the default installation location. On the Custom Setup screen, verify that "Add to PATH" is selected before proceeding.

After installation completes, verify Node.js works correctly. Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog, type `cmd`, and press Enter. In the command prompt window, type `node --version` and press Enter. You should see a version number like `v20.11.0`. Similarly, verify npm by typing `npm --version`, which should display something like `10.2.4`.

### Step 3: Install Git

Download Git from `https://git-scm.com/` by clicking "Download for Windows". This downloads a file like `Git-2.XX.X-64-bit.exe`. Run the installer from your Downloads folder with administrator permission.

The Git installer presents numerous configuration screens. Maintain the default selections for most options, with these specific choices: Select "Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor" when prompted for an editor choice. Choose "Override the default branch name" and set it to "main". Select "Git from the command line and 3rd party software" for PATH environment configuration. Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" for line ending conversions.

After installation, verify Git functionality by opening a new command prompt and typing `git --version`. You should see output like `git version 2.42.0.windows.1`.

### Step 4: Install Warp Terminal

Warp provides a modern terminal experience with integrated AI assistance. Download [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/2KPYGE) by clicking "Download for Windows". Run the installer with default options and launch Warp when installation completes.

Warp improves upon Command Prompt and PowerShell through its modern interface with tabs, intelligent autocompletion, built-in AI help accessible with the `#` symbol, and superior text rendering. Use Warp as your primary terminal moving forward.

**Important Note About PowerShell**: While PowerShell will technically work for most course commands, you will miss significant benefits by not using Warp Terminal. The integrated AI assistance in Warp helps you learn commands, debug errors, and understand what you are doing in real-time. PowerShell users will need to rely on external resources for the same support. Additionally, some course instructions may reference Warp-specific features that PowerShell lacks. We strongly recommend using Warp Terminal to ensure the best learning experience and to stay aligned with course materials.

#### Understanding Warp Better

Warp is a modern terminal built for speed and efficiency. Key features include Command Palette for quick command access, Split Panes for multiple terminal sessions, Persistent Sessions that survive window closure, and Built-in Git Integration for repository management.

Warp offers Warp University and YouTube tutorials to help you master the terminal:

### Step 5: Install Claude Desktop

While Claude Desktop does not have a traditional Windows installer like other tools, you can access Claude through the web interface at `https://claude.ai` or download the desktop app when available. Sign in with your existing Claude account or create one.

Claude Pro is listed as a course requirement in lieu of textbook expenses. Visit claude.ai in your browser, sign in to your account, navigate to your subscription settings, and choose the Pro plan for $20 per month. Claude Pro provides enhanced performance, increased usage limits, and access to latest Claude models.

**Important:** Claude Pro is not required for the initial setup or course participation. But, you may want to budget for this $20 monthly expenditure now as we may use it in future lessons. If you do not want to use Claude Pro right away, you can skip this step for now.

### Step 6: Install GitHub CLI

Visit `https://cli.github.com/` and click "Download for Windows" to download a file like `gh_2.XX.X_windows_amd64.msi`. Run the installer with administrator permission, maintaining all default options throughout the installation wizard.

Verify installation by opening Warp and typing `gh --version`. You should see output like `gh version 2.40.1`.

### Step 7: Authenticate GitHub CLI

Ensure you are logged into GitHub in your web browser before proceeding. In Warp, type `gh auth login` and press Enter. Follow the authentication prompts: Select "GitHub.com" for where you use GitHub. Choose "HTTPS" as your preferred protocol. Select "Yes" to authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials. Choose "Login with a web browser" for authentication method.

Copy the one-time code displayed (like "7516-60CE"), press Enter to open GitHub in your browser, and paste the code when prompted. Click Authorize to complete authentication. Verify success by typing `gh auth status`, which should show "Logged in to github.com" with your username.

### Step 8: Create Your Development Folder

Open File Explorer with Windows key + E. Navigate to your user folder by clicking "This PC", then your C: drive, then Users, then your username folder. Right-click in an empty area and select New â†’ Folder. Name it exactly `Code` with a capital C.

Test the setup by right-clicking your Code folder. You should see "Open with Code" in the context menu. Click it to open the folder in VS Code. If VS Code opens with your Code folder visible in the sidebar, your setup is complete.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Installation Problems

When encountering "Windows protected your PC" messages, click "More info" then "Run anyway". This warning appears for downloaded installers as a security precaution but does not indicate actual danger for legitimate software.

Permission errors require running installers as administrator. Right-click the installer file and select "Run as administrator", entering your admin password if prompted.

If commands are not recognized after installation, restart your computer completely to refresh the PATH environment variable. The system needs this restart to recognize newly installed command-line tools.

### Essential Windows Keyboard Shortcuts

Master these keyboard shortcuts for efficient Windows development: Windows + E opens File Explorer for quick navigation. Windows + R opens the Run dialog for launching programs. Within VS Code, Ctrl + Shift + P opens the command palette for accessing all features, while Ctrl + backtick opens the integrated terminal.

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### HW: Installation Verification

Open Warp Terminal and run these verification commands to confirm successful installation:

```bash
# Check each tool's version
git --version
code --version
node --version
npm --version
gh --version
gh auth status
```

Each command should return a version number or status confirmation. The spacing between commands and flags (like `git --version`) is critical. These delimiter spaces allow the terminal to distinguish between the command and its options.

Submit screenshots or a video (no narration needed) to show the output of each command. Ensure the terminal window is large enough to read the text clearly. If any command fails, troubleshoot the installation steps or refer to the troubleshooting section below.

### Troubleshooting Quick Reference

If VS Code will not open, check your Start menu for "Visual Studio Code" or try running the installer again as administrator. For Node commands not found, restart your computer to refresh PATH, then reinstall Node.js if necessary, ensuring "Add to PATH" is selected. Git recognition issues may require checking for Git Bash in your Start menu or restarting your computer. If you cannot create the Code folder, verify you are in your user folder with appropriate permissions.
