# Objects and Arrays - React Prep Review

## Introduction: Working with Complex Data

Welcome to one of the most crucial lessons in this JavaScript review! We're diving deep into **objects** and **arrays** - the two most important data structures in JavaScript. These aren't just academic concepts; they're the building blocks you'll use constantly in React and modern web development.

### Real-World Scenario: Student Information System

Imagine you're building a student information system for SWIC. You need to store and manipulate data about students, their grades, courses, and schedules. How would you organize this complex information? That's where objects and arrays shine!

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Create and manipulate JavaScript objects using multiple syntax approaches
- Work with arrays and their powerful built-in methods
- Combine objects and arrays to represent complex data structures
- Understand how these concepts directly apply to React development
- Use modern JavaScript features like destructuring and spread operators
- Apply professional Git workflow with meaningful commits

These videos provide a quick overview of the concepts. You'll still want to read through the lesson content below for detailed explanations and hands-on practice!

## Getting Started: Setup Your Project

**üö® CRITICAL FOR GRADING**: You **MUST** use the GitHub Classroom assignment repository provided through BrightSpace. Do **NOT** create your own repository or use the Node.js template repository setup process.

### 1. Accept Your GitHub Classroom Assignment

**If you haven't already:**

- Follow the assignment link from BrightSpace
- Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
- This creates a **personalized repository** specifically for your assignment submission
- This is the **ONLY** repository that will be graded

**Why GitHub Classroom?** Your instructor needs to access your specific repository for grading. Creating your own repository means your work won't be visible for assessment.

### 2. Clone Your Assignment Repository

**Use the repository created by GitHub Classroom** (not the general Node.js template):

- Navigate to your assignment repository on GitHub
- Click the green "Code" button
- Copy the clone command
- Clone to your local development environment

### 3. Follow the Setup Instructions

**Refer to the README.md file in your assignment repository** for complete setup instructions including:

- Installing dependencies with `npm install`
- Verifying your development environment
- Running your first test

**Quick verification**: Once set up, you should be able to run `node src/test.js` and see output in your terminal.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Remember**: All your work for this lesson should be committed and pushed to your GitHub Classroom assignment repository. This is how your instructor will access and grade your submission.

**‚ö†Ô∏è:** The code snippets in this lesson are for demonstrating concepts. The code as shown may not pass linting, which is more strict. It will be your job to ensure your version of the code passes linting.

## Core Concept Overview: Objects

**Note**: The following sections contain code examples for understanding concepts. You're not required to code along until the "Hands-On Application" section, but feel free to experiment with any examples that help your understanding. When you see React code later, don't try to run it in Node.js.

Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. Think of them as **digital filing cabinets** where each piece of information has a label (key) and content (value).

### Object Basics

```javascript
// Object literal syntax - the most common way
const student = {
  firstName: "Maria",
  lastName: "Rodriguez",
  age: 19,
  major: "Computer Science",
  gpa: 3.8,
  isEnrolled: true,
};

// Accessing properties - two ways
console.log(student.firstName); // "Maria" (dot notation - preferred)
console.log(student["lastName"]); // "Rodriguez" (bracket notation - flexible)
```

### Why Two Ways to Access Properties?

**Dot notation** (`student.firstName`) is cleaner and more common, but **bracket notation** (`student["firstName"]`) is more powerful:

```javascript
const student = {
  firstName: "Maria",
  favoriteCourse: "Web Development", // ‚úÖ GOOD: Use camelCase
};

// Dot notation for normal properties
console.log(student.favoriteCourse); // "Web Development"

// Bracket notation for dynamic access
const propertyName = "firstName";
console.log(student[propertyName]); // "Maria"

// Bracket notation for computed properties
const field = "Course";
console.log(student[`favorite${field}`]); // "Web Development"
```

### Objects as Containers for Complex Data

Think of objects like **labeled storage containers** - each container (property) holds exactly what its label says:

```javascript
const student = {
  // Simple values
  name: "Maria Rodriguez",
  age: 19,

  // Arrays inside objects
  courses: ["Math 101", "CS 277", "English 102"],

  // Objects inside objects (nested)
  address: {
    street: "123 College Ave",
    city: "Belleville",
    state: "Illinois",
  },

  // Functions inside objects (methods)
  getFullAddress() {
    return `${this.address.street}, ${this.address.city}, ${this.address.state}`;
  },
};

// Accessing nested data
console.log(student.address.city); // "Belleville"
console.log(student.courses[0]); // "Math 101"
```

### Key Terms

- **Property**: A key-value pair in an object (`name: "Maria"`)
- **Method**: A function stored as an object property
- **Object literal**: Creating objects using `{}` syntax
- **Dot notation**: Accessing properties with `.` (preferred when possible)
- **Bracket notation**: Accessing properties with `[]` (required for dynamic access)
- **Nested object**: An object stored as a property of another object

---

## Core Concept Overview: Arrays

Arrays are **ordered lists** of values. Think of them as **numbered storage boxes** where each box has a position number (index) starting from 0.

### Array Basics

```javascript
// Array literal syntax - the most common way
const courses = ["Math 101", "CS 277", "English 102"];

// Accessing elements by position (index)
console.log(courses[0]); // "Math 101" (first element)
console.log(courses[1]); // "CS 277" (second element)
console.log(courses.length); // 3 (total number of elements)

// Getting the last element (two ways)
console.log(courses[courses.length - 1]); // "English 102" (traditional)
console.log(courses.at(-1)); // "English 102" (modern approach)
```

**Why start counting at 0?** Computers count starting from 0, not 1. So the "first" element is at position 0, the "second" is at position 1, and so on.

### Essential Array Methods

Arrays come with powerful built-in methods. Think of these as **tools for working with your list**:

#### Adding and Removing Elements

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];

// Add to end
fruits.push("orange");
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

// Remove from end  
const lastFruit = fruits.pop();
console.log(lastFruit); // "orange"
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana"]

// Add to beginning
fruits.unshift("grape");
console.log(fruits); // ["grape", "apple", "banana"]

// Remove from beginning
const firstFruit = fruits.shift();
console.log(firstFruit); // "grape"
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana"]
```

**Note for React**: The above methods modify the original array. In React, we prefer methods that create new arrays instead.

#### Searching and Finding

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 5, 3, 8, 5, 9];

// Check if element exists
console.log(numbers.includes(5)); // true
console.log(numbers.includes(10)); // false

// Find index of element
console.log(numbers.indexOf(5)); // 1 (first occurrence)
console.log(numbers.lastIndexOf(5)); // 4 (last occurrence)

// Find element with condition (this is powerful!)
const students = [
  { name: "Maria", gpa: 3.8 },
  { name: "John", gpa: 3.2 },
  { name: "Sarah", gpa: 3.9 },
];

const highAchiever = students.find((student) => student.gpa > 3.5);
console.log(highAchiever); // { name: "Maria", gpa: 3.8 }
```

**Understanding the `find` example**: The `find` method takes a **callback function** as an argument. This function gets called for each element in the array until it finds one that returns `true`. It's like having an assistant check each student until they find one with a GPA over 3.5.

## Hands-On Application: Building a Course Management System

Let's build a practical example that combines objects and arrays. This mimics what you'll do in React applications!

Comments are used extensively to explain each part. You can include them or not. You may also add your own comments to help your understanding. In fact, it is encouraged, and if your comments match exactly what's here, it probably means that you did too much copying and pasting üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

### Exercise 1: Create the Foundation

Create `src/object-basics.js`:

```javascript
// Course data structure - just plain objects and arrays
const course = {
  id: "CS277",
  title: "Web Development Fundamentals",
  instructor: "Prof. Johnson",
  credits: 3,
  students: [
    {
      id: "s001",
      name: "Maria Rodriguez",
      email: "mrodriguez@swic.edu",
      grades: [85, 92, 78, 88],
    },
    {
      id: "s002",
      name: "John Smith",
      email: "jsmith@swic.edu",
      grades: [90, 87, 95, 92],
    },
    {
      id: "s003",
      name: "Sarah Chen",
      email: "schen@swic.edu",
      grades: [78, 85, 82, 90],
    },
  ],
};

// Test basic object access
console.info("Course:", course.title);
console.info("Instructor:", course.instructor);
console.info("Number of students:", course.students.length);

// Access nested object data
console.info("First student:", course.students[0].name);
console.info("First student's grades:", course.students[0].grades);
```

**Test your code**: `node src/object-basics.js`

**Commit your progress**:

```bash
git add src/object-basics.js
git commit -m "Add object basics practice with course data structure"
```

### Exercise 2: Working with Functions and Data

Create `src/course-functions.js`:

```javascript
// Import or recreate the course data (for this exercise, we'll recreate)
const course = {
  id: "CS277",
  title: "Web Development Fundamentals",
  instructor: "Prof. Johnson",
  credits: 3,
  students: [
    {
      id: "s001",
      name: "Maria Rodriguez",
      email: "mrodriguez@swic.edu",
      grades: [85, 92, 78, 88],
    },
    {
      id: "s002",
      name: "John Smith",
      email: "jsmith@swic.edu",
      grades: [90, 87, 95, 92],
    },
    {
      id: "s003",
      name: "Sarah Chen",
      email: "schen@swic.edu",
      grades: [78, 85, 82, 90],
    },
  ],
};

// Separate functions that work with the data (like React!)
const getStudentAverage = (students, studentId) => {
  const student = students.find((s) => s.id === studentId);
  if (!student || student.grades.length === 0) return 0;

  // Calculate total using reduce() method
  // reduce() takes each grade and adds it to a running sum, starting at 0
  const total = student.grades.reduce((sum, grade) => sum + grade, 0);
  return Math.round(total / student.grades.length);
};

const getHighPerformers = (students, threshold = 85) => {
  return students.filter((student) => {
    const avg = getStudentAverage(students, student.id);
    return avg >= threshold;
  });
};

// üí° Quick Review: Default Parameters
// Notice `threshold = 85` above? That's a default parameter!
// If no threshold is provided, it defaults to 85.
// This is common in React for optional props and function parameters.

// Examples:
console.info("=== Testing Course Functions ===");

// Get Maria's average grade
const mariaAverage = getStudentAverage(course.students, "s001");
console.info("Maria's average:", mariaAverage);

// Get all high performers (>= 85 average)
const topStudents = getHighPerformers(course.students, 85);
console.info(
  "High performers:",
  topStudents.map((s) => s.name),
);

// Test with different threshold
const excellentStudents = getHighPerformers(course.students, 90);
console.info(
  "Excellent students (90+):",
  excellentStudents.map((s) => s.name),
);
```

**Test your code**: `node src/course-functions.js`

**Commit your progress**:

```bash
git add src/course-functions.js
git commit -m "Add course management functions with student calculations"
```

### Exercise 3: Essential Array Operations for React

Create `src/array-methods.js`:

```javascript
// Sample data for array method practice
const course = {
  students: [
    {
      id: "s001",
      name: "Maria Rodriguez",
      email: "mrodriguez@swic.edu",
      grades: [85, 92, 78, 88],
    },
    {
      id: "s002",
      name: "John Smith",
      email: "jsmith@swic.edu",
      grades: [90, 87, 95, 92],
    },
    {
      id: "s003",
      name: "Sarah Chen",
      email: "schen@swic.edu",
      grades: [78, 85, 82, 90],
    },
  ],
};

// Helper function from previous exercise
const getStudentAverage = (students, studentId) => {
  const student = students.find((s) => s.id === studentId);
  if (!student || student.grades.length === 0) return 0;
  const total = student.grades.reduce((sum, grade) => sum + grade, 0);
  return Math.round(total / student.grades.length);
};

console.info("=== Essential Array Methods for React ===");

// 1. MAP - Transform each element (like rendering a list in React)
const studentNames = course.students.map((student) => student.name);
console.info("All student names:", studentNames);
// ["Maria Rodriguez", "John Smith", "Sarah Chen"]

// 2. FILTER - Select elements based on a condition
// The function you pass is called a 'predicate function'
// Whether an element is included is PREDICATED on returning true/false

const topPerformers = course.students.filter((student) => {
  const avg = getStudentAverage(course.students, student.id);
  return avg >= 90; // This is the predicate - true/false determines inclusion
});
console.info(
  "Top performers:",
  topPerformers.map((s) => s.name),
);

// 3. FIND - Get the first element that matches a condition
const firstHighAchiever = course.students.find((student) => {
  const avg = getStudentAverage(course.students, student.id);
  return avg >= 85; // Predicate function again!
});
console.info("First high achiever:", firstHighAchiever.name);

// 4. REDUCE - Combine all elements into a single value
const totalGrades = course.students.reduce((total, student) => {
  return total + student.grades.length;
}, 0);
console.info("Total number of grades recorded:", totalGrades);

// Bonus: Check if something is an array (useful for defensive programming)
if (Array.isArray(course.students)) {
  console.info(`We have ${course.students.length} students`);
}

// Practice chaining methods (very common in React)
const highPerformerEmails = course.students
  .filter((student) => getStudentAverage(course.students, student.id) >= 85)
  .map((student) => student.email);

console.info("High performer emails:", highPerformerEmails);
```

**Test your code**: `node src/array-methods.js`

**Commit your progress**:

```bash
git add src/array-methods.js
git commit -m "Practice essential array methods for React development"
```

## Advanced Concepts & Modern JavaScript Features

### Exercise 4: Destructuring and Spread Operators

Create `src/modern-features.js`:

```javascript
console.info("=== Modern JavaScript Features ===");

// Sample student object for destructuring practice
const student = {
  name: "Maria Rodriguez",
  age: 19,
  major: "Computer Science",
  gpa: 3.8,
  address: {
    street: "123 College Ave",
    city: "Belleville",
    state: "Illinois",
  },
};

// OBJECT DESTRUCTURING
console.info("\n--- Object Destructuring ---");

// Old way (tedious)
const name = student.name;
const age = student.age;

// Destructuring way (elegant!)
const { name: studentName, age: studentAge, major } = student;
console.info("Student info:", studentName, studentAge, major);

// Rename variables during destructuring
const { name: fullName, gpa: gradePointAverage } = student;
console.info("GPA info:", fullName, gradePointAverage);

// Default values (in case property doesn't exist)
const { graduationYear = 2025 } = student;
console.info("Expected graduation:", graduationYear);

// Nested destructuring (getting city and state from address)
const {
  address: { city, state },
} = student;
console.info("Location:", city, state);

// ARRAY DESTRUCTURING
console.info("\n--- Array Destructuring ---");

const grades = [85, 92, 78, 88, 94];

// Extract first few grades
const [first, second, third] = grades;
console.info("First three grades:", first, second, third);

// Skip elements (note the empty spaces)
const [firstGrade, , thirdGrade] = grades;
console.info("First and third:", firstGrade, thirdGrade);

// Rest operator (collect remaining elements)
const [highest, ...remainingGrades] = grades.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.info("Highest grade:", highest);
console.info("Remaining grades:", remainingGrades);

// SPREAD OPERATOR
console.info("\n--- Spread Operator ---");

// Array spreading (combining arrays)
const originalGrades = [85, 92, 78];
const newGrades = [88, 94];
const allGrades = [...originalGrades, ...newGrades];
console.info("All grades combined:", allGrades);

// Object spreading (copying and extending objects)
const basicStudent = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 20,
};

const detailedStudent = {
  ...basicStudent,
  major: "Engineering",
  gpa: 3.5,
  age: 21, // This overrides the age from basicStudent
};

console.info("Detailed student:", detailedStudent);

// Practical example: Adding a new student (React pattern)
const existingStudents = [
  { id: 1, name: "Maria", gpa: 3.8 },
  { id: 2, name: "John", gpa: 3.2 },
];

const newStudent = { id: 3, name: "Sarah", gpa: 3.9 };
const updatedStudents = [...existingStudents, newStudent];

console.info("Updated student list:", updatedStudents);
```

**Test your code**: `node src/modern-features.js`

**Commit your progress**:

```bash
git add src/modern-features.js
git commit -m "Practice destructuring and spread operators for modern JS"
```

### Exercise 5: React State Management Patterns

Create `src/state-patterns.js`:

```javascript
console.info("=== React State Management Patterns ===");

// Initial state (like React useState)
const initialCourse = {
  id: "CS277",
  title: "Web Development Fundamentals",
  students: [
    { id: 1, name: "Maria", gpa: 3.8 },
    { id: 2, name: "John", gpa: 3.2 },
  ],
};

console.info("Initial course:", initialCourse);

// IMMUTABLE UPDATES (React way)
console.info("\n--- Adding Students (Immutable) ---");

// ‚ùå Bad: Mutates original (breaks React!)
const badAddStudent = (course, newStudent) => {
  course.students.push(newStudent); // BAD: mutates original
  return course;
};

// ‚úÖ Good: Creates new objects (React approved!)
const addStudent = (course, newStudent) => {
  return {
    ...course,
    students: [...course.students, newStudent],
  };
};

const newStudent = { id: 3, name: "Sarah", gpa: 3.9 };
const updatedCourse = addStudent(initialCourse, newStudent);

console.info("Original course students:", initialCourse.students.length);
console.info("Updated course students:", updatedCourse.students.length);
console.info("Objects are different:", initialCourse !== updatedCourse);

// UPDATING STUDENT DATA
console.info("\n--- Updating Student GPA ---");

const updateStudentGPA = (course, studentId, newGPA) => {
  return {
    ...course,
    students: course.students.map((student) =>
      student.id === studentId ? { ...student, gpa: newGPA } : student,
    ),
  };
};

const courseWithUpdatedGPA = updateStudentGPA(updatedCourse, 2, 3.7);
console.info(
  "John's updated GPA:",
  courseWithUpdatedGPA.students.find((s) => s.id === 2).gpa,
);

// FILTERING STUDENTS
console.info("\n--- Filtering High Performers ---");

const getHighPerformers = (course, threshold = 3.5) => {
  return {
    ...course,
    students: course.students.filter((student) => student.gpa >= threshold),
    title: `${course.title} - High Performers`,
  };
};

const highPerformersCourse = getHighPerformers(courseWithUpdatedGPA, 3.5);
console.info("High performers course:", highPerformersCourse);

// OBJECT METHODS DEEP DIVE
console.info("\n--- Object Analysis Methods ---");

const sampleStudent = {
  firstName: "Maria",
  lastName: "Rodriguez",
  age: 19,
  major: "Computer Science",
};

// Get all keys
const keys = Object.keys(sampleStudent);
console.info("Student property keys:", keys);

// Get all values
const values = Object.values(sampleStudent);
console.info("Student property values:", values);

// Get key-value pairs
const entries = Object.entries(sampleStudent);
console.info("Student entries:", entries);

// Iterate over object properties
console.info("Student information:");
Object.entries(sampleStudent).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.info(`  ${key}: ${value}`);
});
```

**Test your code**: `node src/state-patterns.js`

**Commit your progress**:

```bash
git add src/state-patterns.js
git commit -m "Practice React state management patterns with immutable updates"
```

## React Connection: Why This Matters

Understanding objects and arrays is crucial for React development. Here's a quick preview of how these concepts directly apply:

**Component Props** - React components receive data as objects:

```javascript
// This is React code - don't try to run this in Node.js!
function StudentCard({ name, age, major, gpa }) {
  // The props parameter is an object that gets destructured
  return (
    <div>
      {name} - {major}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**State Management** - React state often contains arrays and objects that you manipulate using the immutable patterns you just practiced.

**Array Rendering** - The `map()` method you practiced is essential for displaying lists in React:

```javascript
// React uses map() constantly for rendering lists
{
  students.map((student) => <div key={student.id}>{student.name}</div>);
}
```

**The patterns you just learned** - creating new objects with spread operators, filtering arrays, and avoiding mutations - are exactly how React state management works.

---

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Mutating arrays directly in React**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Don't do this in React
students.push(newStudent); // Mutates original array
setStudents(students);

// ‚úÖ Do this instead
setStudents([...students, newStudent]); // Creates new array
```

2. **Forgetting array methods return new arrays**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// ‚ùå map() returns a new array, doesn't modify original
numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
console.log(numbers); // Still [1, 2, 3]

// ‚úÖ Capture the returned array
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
```

3. **Confusing reference vs value**

```javascript
// Objects are passed by reference
const student1 = { name: "Maria", age: 19 };
const student2 = student1; // Same reference!
student2.age = 20;
console.log(student1.age); // 20 - both changed!

// Create a copy instead
const student3 = { ...student1 }; // New object with same properties
```

### Industry Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive property names**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Unclear
const u = { n: "Maria", a: 19 };

// ‚úÖ Clear and descriptive
const user = { name: "Maria", age: 19 };
```

2. **Prefer immutable operations**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Mutating (changing original)
const addGrade = (student, newGrade) => {
  student.grades.push(newGrade);
  return student;
};

// ‚úÖ Immutable (creating new)
const addGrade = (student, newGrade) => ({
  ...student,
  grades: [...student.grades, newGrade],
});
```

3. **Use array methods instead of loops**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Manual loop (note: let is appropriate here for loop variable)
const highGrades = [];
for (let i = 0; i < grades.length; i++) {
  if (grades[i] >= 90) {
    highGrades.push(grades[i]);
  }
}

// ‚úÖ Array method
const highGrades = grades.filter((grade) => grade >= 90);
```

4. **Validate data structure**

```javascript
const getStudentAverage = (student) => {
  // Defensive programming
  if (
    !student ||
    !Array.isArray(student.grades) ||
    student.grades.length === 0
  ) {
    return 0;
  }

  return (
    student.grades.reduce((sum, grade) => sum + grade, 0) /
    student.grades.length
  );
};
```

### HW: Advanced Grade Book Challenge

**Using your GitHub Classroom assignment repo**, complete this comprehensive challenge:

#### Challenge: Complete Grade Book System

Create `src/gradebook-challenge.js` with this starter code:

```javascript
const gradeBook = {

#### Requirements

1. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Use `map`, `filter`, and/or `find` appropriately
   - Ensure all operations are immutable (no mutations!)
   - Include defensive programming (check for valid data)
   - Test your functions with console.info statements

2. **Video Walkthrough** (3-5 minutes):
   - Record yourself running: `node src/gradebook-challenge.js`
   - Explain how you implemented each method
   - Why you chose certain array methods
   - How you ensured immutability
   - Walk through your test cases

3. **Final Git Workflow**:
   ```bash
   git add src/gradebook-challenge.js
   git commit -m "Complete advanced gradebook challenge with immutable operations"
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Submission Requirements

- **Repository link**: Your GitHub Classroom repository with all exercises completed
- **Video walkthrough**: Demonstrating your gradebook implementation
- **Git history**: Clean commits showing your progression through the lesson
- **Learning reflection**: Create a markdown document addressing the reflection questions below

### Learning Reflection Document

Create a markdown document (GitHub Gist or similar) addressing these questions:

1. **Skill Assessment**: How comfortable do you feel with objects and arrays now compared to when you started this lesson? What specific concepts clicked for you?

2. **React Readiness**: Based on the React preview section, what aspects of React development are you most/least confident about?

3. **Array Methods Mastery**: Which array method (`map`, `filter`, `find`, `reduce`) do you feel most confident using? Which needs more practice?

4. **Immutability Understanding**: Explain in your own words why we avoid mutating arrays and objects in React. What would happen if we did mutate them?

5. **Git Workflow**: How did the commit-as-you-go workflow feel? Did it help or hinder your learning process?

6. **Problem Areas**: What part of this lesson was most challenging? What would you like more practice with?

**Alternative Option**: Instead of a written reflection, record a 3-4 minute "selfie style" video walking through your completed repository, explaining what you learned and how confident you feel moving toward React development.

### Challenge Questions to Address in Your Video

1. Why did you choose specific array methods for each implementation?
2. How did you handle edge cases (empty arrays, missing data)?
3. What would break if you used mutating methods instead?
4. How do these patterns prepare you for React development?

### Looking Ahead

These object and array concepts are the foundation for everything we'll do in React:

- **Props** are objects passed to components
- **State** often contains arrays and objects
- **Event handlers** frequently manipulate arrays and objects
- **API responses** are typically arrays of objects

Next up: We'll put all these JavaScript fundamentals together in a hands-on vanilla JavaScript project with ES modules (import/export) where you'll see exactly why we need frameworks like React for complex applications!
