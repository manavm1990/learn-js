const firstName = "Your Name";
const lastName = "Your Last Name";
const birthYear = 2000; // Your birth year
const currentYear = 2024;
const favoriteNumber = 7; // Your favorite number
const city = "Your City";

// Calculate your age
const age = currentYear - birthYear;

// Create formatted outputs
console.log("=== Personal Information ===");
console.log("Full Name:", firstName + " " + lastName);
console.log("Age:", age, "years old");
console.log("Hometown:", city);
console.log("Favorite Number:", favoriteNumber);

// Fun calculations
const ageInMonths = age * 12;
const ageInDays = age * 365; // Approximate
const favNumberSquared = favoriteNumber * favoriteNumber;

console.log("\n=== Fun Facts ===");
console.log("Age in months:", ageInMonths);
console.log("Age in days (approx):", ageInDays);
console.log("Favorite number squared:", favNumberSquared);

// Commit this file
```

**Problem 2: Simple Calculator**

console.log("Subtraction:", num1 - num2);
console.log("Multiplication:", num1 * num2);
console.log("Division:", num1 / num2);
console.log("Remainder:", num1 % num2);

// Advanced calculations
const average = (num1 + num2) / 2;
const difference = Math.abs(num1 - num2); // Absolute difference

console.log("\n=== Advanced Results ===");
console.log("Average:", average);
console.log("Absolute difference:", difference);
console.log("First number squared:", num1 * num1);

// Challenge: Try changing num1 and num2 to different values
// and run the program again!
```

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### Study Strategies for Programming

| Strategy | Description | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Repetition** | Practice same concept multiple times | Learning syntax | Writing 10 different variable declarations |
| **Variation** | Same concept, different contexts | Understanding patterns | Variables in calculators, games, forms |
| **Elaboration** | Connect to existing knowledge | Deep understanding | How variables relate to math algebra |
| **Interleaving** | Mix different concepts together | Real-world application | Project using Git + JavaScript + VS Code |

### Building Programming Habits

**Daily Habits** (15-30 minutes):
- Write code every day, even if just experimenting
- Read error messages carefully instead of panicking
- Use Git to track your daily practice
- Try one new VS Code feature or keyboard shortcut

**Weekly Habits**:
- Review what you learned and identify gaps
- Build a small project combining multiple concepts
- Share your progress with others (social accountability)
- Plan learning goals for the upcoming week

**Monthly Habits**:
- Assess overall progress against initial goals
- Update your development environment and tools
- Connect with other learners or programming communities
- Celebrate achievements and learning milestones

### Error-Driven Learning

**Common JavaScript Errors and What They Teach**:

```javascript
// SyntaxError: Missing quotes
const name = John;  // ❌ Error teaches importance of string syntax
const name = "John"; // ✅ Correct

// ReferenceError: Variable not defined  
console.log(firstName); // ❌ Error teaches variable scope
const firstName = "Jane";
console.log(firstName); // ✅ Correct - declare before use

// TypeError: Cannot read property
const person = undefined; // ❌ Error teaches checking for undefined
console.log(person.name); // This will cause an error
const person = { name: "Alex" }; // ✅ Correct
console.log(person.name); // ✅ Correct
```

**How to Use Errors for Learning**:
1. **Read the error message carefully** - it tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Look at the line number** - errors point to specific locations
3. **Research the error type** - understand what category of mistake it is
4. **Fix and re-run** - see if your solution works
5. **Document the solution** - keep notes for similar future errors

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Homework Challenges

#### "I don't understand what to do"
**Solutions**:
- Re-read the instructions step by step
- Break large tasks into smaller pieces
- Look at the example code provided
- Ask specific questions (not "I don't get it")

#### "My code doesn't work"
**Debugging process**:
1. **Check the error message** - what does it actually say?
2. **Verify file names and paths** - typos are common
3. **Look for syntax errors** - missing quotes, brackets, semicolons
4. **Test with simple examples** - start with basic cases
5. **Use console.log()** to see what values you have

#### "Git commands aren't working"
**Common fixes**:
- Make sure you're in the right directory (`pwd` or `cd`)
- Check if it's a Git repository (`git status`)
- Verify file names exactly match what you created
- Restart terminal if PATH issues persist

### Homework Best Practices

**Time Management**:
- Set aside specific times for homework (consistency helps)
- Take breaks every 30-45 minutes to avoid fatigue
- Don't try to do everything in one sitting
- If stuck for more than 20 minutes, take a break or ask for help

**Quality Over Speed**:
- Focus on understanding, not just completing
- Test your code thoroughly before considering it "done"
- Write clear, meaningful commit messages
- Organize your files and folders properly

**Learning Reinforcement**:
- Explain your code out loud as you write it
- Comment your code to practice explaining what it does
- Try variations of the exercises for extra practice
- Keep notes about what you found difficult or interesting

### Setting Up for Long-term Success

**Create a learning schedule**:
```
Week 1: Environment setup, Git, JavaScript basics
Week 2: Functions, DOM manipulation, interactive web pages
Week 3: Objects, arrays, data manipulation
Week 4: Events, forms, user interaction
...and so on
```

**Track your progress**:
- Keep a learning journal (as part of homework!)
- Document challenges and how you solved them
- Note concepts that need more practice
- Celebrate small wins and milestones
