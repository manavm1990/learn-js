# Terminal and TXT Files: Your First Steps in Coding

**Time estimate:** 1–1.5 hours

## Introduction

You're about to write your first code—not JavaScript, not HTML—but something far more practical: **terminal commands** and **plain-text files**.

Right now, you just need to know 4 things:

1. **`pwd`** — "Where am I?"
2. **`cd`** — "Move to a folder"
3. **`ls`** — "What's in here?"
4. **`code .`** — "Open this folder in VS Code"

That's it. You'll spend some time practicing these four things until they feel like muscle memory. Once they do, every lesson after this one becomes easier because you'll navigate projects like a real developer.

## Core Concept: The Terminal is Just Another Way to Navigate

You already know how to navigate your computer using the **GUI** (the Graphical User Interface—folders, double-clicks, dragging files). The terminal is just a **text-based way** to do the exact same things.

Compare:

| Action                   | GUI                       | Terminal        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| "Where am I?"            | Look at the folder window | `pwd`           |
| "What's in this folder?" | See the folder contents   | `ls`            |
| "Go into that folder"    | Double-click it           | `cd foldername` |
| "Go back one level"      | Click the back arrow      | `cd ..`         |
| "Go home"                | Click Home in the sidebar | `cd ~`          |

One is visual. One is text-based. Both do the same job.

## The 4 Commands You Need Right Now

Don't use these just yet. First, read through what each does and why it's useful.

### 1. `pwd` — Print Working Directory

**What it does:** Shows you exactly where you are in your computer's folder structure.

```bash
pwd
```

You might see output like:  
`/Users/yourname/Dev/projects`

This means: "I'm in the `projects` folder, which is inside `Dev`, which is inside `yourname`, which is inside `Users`." It's a **path**—a map to your current location.

**Use case:** Anytime you're unsure where you are, type `pwd`. It's like looking up at a street sign.

### 2. `ls` — List

**What it does:** Shows all the files and folders in your current location.

```bash
ls
```

You might see something like:

```
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
bio.txt
styles.css
```

**With flags (the 🏴 way):**

Flags are little options you add to commands. The most useful flag for `ls` is `-l` (lowercase L):

```bash
ls -l
```

This shows more detail about each file (size, date modified, permissions). Try it—you'll see the difference immediately.

Another useful flag: `-a` shows **all** files, including hidden ones (files starting with a dot, like `.gitignore`):

```bash
ls -a
```

You can combine flags:

```bash
ls -la
```

This shows all files with details. Most developers use this a lot.

### 3. `cd` — Change Directory

**What it does:** Moves you into a different folder.

```bash
cd Dev
```

Now you're **inside** the `Dev` folder. If you type `pwd`, you'll see your path has changed.

**Special `cd` tricks:**

- `cd ~` — Go to your home folder (where Documents, Downloads, etc. live)
- `cd ..` — Go **up one level** (to the parent folder)
- `cd` (just `cd` alone) — Go to home folder (same as `cd ~`)
- `cd /` — Go to the very root of your computer (rarely needed)

**Pro tip:** Type `cd Dev` then press **Tab**. The terminal will auto-complete. This saves typing and prevents mistakes.

### 4. `code .` — Open in VS Code

**What it does:** Opens the current folder in Visual Studio Code.

```bash
code .
```

The dot (`.`) means "the current folder I'm standing in." VS Code will launch and show all the files in that folder.

**This is huge because:**

- You navigate to your project folder using the terminal
- You open it in VS Code with one command
- This is how developers work every single day

## Hands-On: Create Your First Project

Open up Warp Terminal.

**Note for Windows Users:** If you hit permission issues in Warp Terminal, switch to GitBash and re-run the command. Warp is great for AI assistance, but GitBash is our backup.

### Step 1: Navigate Home

```bash
pwd
```

See where you are. Now go home:

```bash
cd ~
```

Verify:

```bash
pwd
```

### Step 2: Create a Dev Folder

```bash
mkdir Dev
cd Dev
```

Verify you're in the right place:

```bash
pwd
ls
```

### Step 3: Create a Practice Folder

```bash
mkdir TXTPractice
cd TXTPractice
```

Verify:

```bash
pwd
```

### Step 4: Create a Text File

```bash
touch bio.txt
```

Check it was created:

```bash
ls
```

### Step 5: Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

VS Code will open showing your folder. You should see `bio.txt` in the file explorer.

### Step 6: Write in Your File

Click `bio.txt` in VS Code and type a few sentences about yourself. Save it with `Cmd + S` (Mac) or `Ctrl + S` (Windows).

### Step 7: Verify from Terminal

Go back to your terminal. You're still in the `TXTPractice` folder. List the files:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `bio.txt`. You just created a file, opened it in an editor, wrote to it, and verified it from the terminal. **This is how developers work.**

## Key Takeaway

The terminal is just another way to navigate your computer. You've learned the four commands you **need** right now. Everything else builds on top of these four. Keep practicing until they feel natural. By next week, using `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, and `code .` should feel as automatic as using your mouse.
