# Computer Science Fundamentals 3: Arrays & Loops

## Introduction

### Icebreaker: The Hard Way

You have five classmates. Log each of their names to the console.

Easy enough:

```javascript
console.log("Alice");
console.log("Bob");
console.log("Carol");
console.log("Dave");
console.log("Eve");
```

Now imagine you have 500 classmates. Or 5,000 grocery items. Or every student at SWIC.

Writing that out by hand isn't just tedious — it's the wrong tool for the job. This is exactly the kind of work computers were built to do: repeat the same task, tirelessly, without making mistakes.

Today you'll learn the two tools that make that possible: **arrays** and **loops**.


Let's learn about ➿s. Let's learn about ➿s. Let's learn about ➿s.

### What You Already Know

In [Comp. Sci. Fundamentals 2](/js-comp-sci-2), you learned:

- ✅ Ternary operators for concise decisions
- ✅ Truthiness and falsiness
- ✅ Switch statements
- ✅ The refactoring mindset

**This lesson builds on that.** You know how to make decisions. Now you'll learn how to repeat them.

### What You'll Learn Today

- **Arrays**: Storing ordered lists of values
- **`for` loops**: Repeating code a specific number of times
- **`while` loops**: Repeating code until a condition changes
- **Iterating over arrays**: Connecting loops and arrays to process lists

## Arrays: Lists of Values

### The Problem with Separate Variables

What if you need to store five names?

```javascript
const name1 = "Alice";
const name2 = "Bob";
const name3 = "Carol";
const name4 = "Dave";
const name5 = "Eve";
```

This falls apart immediately. Five variables for five names. What happens at 500?

### The Solution: Arrays

An **array** is an ordered list of values stored in a single variable.

```javascript
const classmates = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dave", "Eve"];
```

One variable. Five values. And it scales to any size.

### Array Syntax

Create an array with square brackets `[]`. Separate items with commas:

```javascript
// Array of strings
const groceryList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "TP", "Bars", "Bacon", "🥚s"];

// Array of numbers
const scores = [95, 87, 72, 100, 68];

// Array of booleans
const answers = [true, false, true, true, false];
```

### Accessing Items by Index

Every item in an array has a position called an **index**. Indexes start at `0`, not `1`.

```javascript
const groceryList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "TP", "Bars", "Bacon", "🥚s"];
//                        0          1       2      3       4       5

console.log(groceryList[0]); // "Apples"
console.log(groceryList[1]); // "Bananas"
console.log(groceryList[5]); // "🥚s"
```

**The last index is always one less than the total number of items.**

### `array.length`

Every array has a `length` property that tells you how many items it contains:

```javascript
const groceryList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "TP", "Bars", "Bacon", "🥚s"];

console.log(groceryList.length); // 6
```

Length is `6`. Last index is `5`. That off-by-one relationship matters — you'll see why shortly.

To access the **last item** without hardcoding its index:

```javascript
// Last index = length - 1
console.log(groceryList[groceryList.length - 1]); // "🥚s"
```

This works no matter how long the array gets.

**Note:** The dot (`.`) is how you access information ℹ️ attached to a value. JavaScript provides easy access to this information ℹ️ based upon the data type of the value. `length` is one piece of information arrays carry around — it tells you how many items are inside.

### Checkpoint: Arrays

Write answers in your **handwritten** notes ✍️.

1. Create an array called `colors` with three color names.
2. Access the first item. Access the last item without hardcoding the index.
3. What is the index of the third item in any array?
4. If an array has 10 items, what is the last valid index?

---

## The `for` Loop

Computers are great at repetitive tasks. A **loop** is a statement that runs the same block of code repeatedly.

The `for` loop runs code **a specific number of times**. It needs three pieces of information:

```javascript
// for (start; condition; increment)
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  // runs while condition is true
}
```

### The Three Parts

**1. Initialization expression** — runs once, at the start:
```javascript
let i = 0
```
`i` is a counter variable. It starts at `0`. We use `let` (not `const`) because its value changes on every loop. `i` is a convention — it stands for "index."

**2. Conditional expression** — checked before *each* loop:
```javascript
i <= 10
```
As long as this is `true`, the loop keeps running. When it becomes `false`, the loop stops.

**3. Final expression** — runs after *each* loop:
```javascript
i++
```
This increments `i` by `1`. Without this, `i` never reaches `10`, and the loop runs forever — an **infinite loop**. Don't skip it.

> ⚠️ **Infinite Loop Warning**: If your program freezes or stops responding, you likely have an infinite loop. In the terminal, press `Ctrl + C` to kill it.

### A Simple Example

```javascript
// Log numbers 1 through 5
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

Walk through it manually:
- `i = 1` → `1 <= 5` is true → log `1` → `i` becomes `2`
- `i = 2` → `2 <= 5` is true → log `2` → `i` becomes `3`
- ...
- `i = 5` → `5 <= 5` is true → log `5` → `i` becomes `6`
- `i = 6` → `6 <= 5` is false → loop ends

---

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop is simpler in structure. Use it when you don't know exactly how many times you'll loop — just that you want to keep going *while* some condition is true.

```javascript
let i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
  i++; // don't forget this — same infinite loop risk as `for`
}

// i is now 10
```

The structure: declare your counter *before* the loop, check the condition, update the counter *inside* the loop.

### `for` vs. `while`: A Rule of Thumb

- Use `for` when you know the number of iterations upfront (e.g., loop over an array).
- Use `while` when you're waiting for something to change (e.g., keep trying until a condition is met).

In practice, `for` is more common for working with arrays.

---

## Iterating Over an Array

Here's where it comes together. Remember the grocery list problem?

```javascript
const groceryList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "TP", "Bars", "Bacon", "🥚s"];

// The painful way
console.log(groceryList[0]); // Apples
console.log(groceryList[1]); // Bananas
console.log(groceryList[2]); // TP
console.log(groceryList[3]); // Bars
console.log(groceryList[4]); // Bacon
console.log(groceryList[5]); // 🥚s
```

That's not good. 😫

### With a `for` Loop

```javascript
const groceryList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "TP", "Bars", "Bacon", "🥚s"];

/**
 * The first index is 0.
 * The last index is groceryList.length - 1 (which is 5).
 * So: start at 0, keep going while i < groceryList.length.
 * `i` matches the current index on every iteration.
 */
for (let i = 0; i < groceryList.length; i++) {
  console.log(groceryList[i]);
}
```

`i < groceryList.length` is the key. The length is `6`, so the loop runs while `i` is `0` through `5` — exactly the valid indexes.

### With a `while` Loop

```javascript
const groceryList = ["Apples", "Bananas", "TP", "Bars", "Bacon", "🥚s"];

let i = 0;

while (i < groceryList.length) {
  console.log(groceryList[i]);
  i++;
}
```

Same result. Same logic. The `for` version is more common for arrays because it keeps the counter setup, condition, and increment in one place.

---

## Doing More Inside a Loop

A loop doesn't have to just log values. You can run any code inside it.

Here's an example that modifies each value:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  numbers[i] += 1;
}

// numbers is now [2, 3, 4]
```

**Notice something:** `numbers` is declared with `const`, yet we're changing its contents. This works because `const` prevents *reassigning the variable* — it doesn't prevent *modifying what's inside* the array.

This pattern is called **mutation** — you're directly changing the original array. It works, but it can cause problems as programs grow, especially when multiple parts of your code share the same array. A safer approach — transforming an array into a *new* array without touching the original — is something you'll learn when you get to array methods.

### Checkpoint: Loops

Write answers in your **handwritten** notes ✍️.

1. What are the three parts of a `for` loop? What does each one do?
2. What is an infinite loop? What causes one?
3. Why do we use `i < array.length` instead of `i <= array.length`?
4. Why is `let` used for the counter variable instead of `const`?
5. Write a `for` loop that logs each item in this array with its position number:
   ```javascript
   const tasks = ["Laundry", "Dishes", "Homework"];
   // Expected output:
   // 1: Laundry
   // 2: Dishes
   // 3: Homework
   ```
6. Rewrite the same loop using `while`.

## Wrap-Up

### Key Takeaways

**Arrays:**
- Ordered lists stored in a single variable
- Index-based access starting at `0`
- Last index is always `array.length - 1`

**`for` loops:**
- Three parts: initialization, condition, increment
- Use when you know the iteration count upfront
- `i < array.length` is the standard pattern for arrays

**`while` loops:**
- Simpler structure, same infinite loop risk
- Use when you're waiting on a condition, not counting steps

**Mutation:**
- You can modify array contents inside a loop
- Direct mutation works but has tradeoffs — a better pattern is coming

### What's Next

You can now loop over arrays of strings and numbers. But what if each item in the array was more complex — say, a student with a name, a grade, and an ID?

That's where objects come in. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to store and work with more complex data using objects — the other fundamental data structure in JavaScript.
