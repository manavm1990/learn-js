# How Computers and the Web Work

Understanding the foundational concepts of how computers process information and how the web functions under the hood.

## Introduction

### From Clicking to Computing

**Real-world scenario**: You've been building websites with HTML and CSS, but what actually happens when someone clicks a link on your site? How does the browser know what to display? And at the deepest level, how does a computer even understand your code?

People often think of computers as complex machines, but at their core, they are built on simple principles. Understanding how computers work can help you appreciate the technology that powers our daily lives and make you a more informed developer.

We often hear things about 0s and 1s, or binary. But what does that mean? And how does that relate to the web pages you're building?

### What You'll Learn Today

- How computers actually process information (binary, processors, memory)
- What programming really means at a fundamental level
- Essential terminal commands for everyday development work
- How the web works: from URL to rendered page
- How browsers load and display websites
- The connection between these concepts and your future JavaScript work

## Core Concept Overview

### The Foundation: How Computers Think

The following video from Todd McLeod explains the concept of binary in a fun and engaging way.

**Note**: The video mentions the Go programming language, but the concepts are universal. And yes, Go is a fantastic language - maybe not the "best programming language" as Todd suggests, but it is a great one.

### From Binary to Human Language: UTF-8 and Unicode

Now that you understand how computers work with binary (1s and 0s), you might wonder: how do computers represent the letters, symbols, and characters we use every day? How does a computer know that a certain pattern of 1s and 0s represents the letter "A" or an emoji?

This fascinating video from Computerphile explains how human language translates to machine language through character encoding, specifically UTF-8 and the Unicode standard:

**Video**: [Characters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)

**Key concepts you'll learn**:

- How computers represent text characters as numbers
- The evolution from ASCII to Unicode
- Why UTF-8 became the web standard
- How emojis and international characters work
- The connection between character encoding and web development

**Why this matters for web developers**: Every webpage you create uses UTF-8 encoding to display text correctly across different languages and devices. Understanding this helps you avoid common character encoding issues and appreciate the complexity behind something as simple as typing text on a webpage.

**Fun Fact:** UTF-8 even includes constructed languages like Klingon from Star Trek! This universal approach to character encoding - representing all forms of human communication, real or imagined - is actually foundational to modern AI translation systems. When you use Google Translate or ChatGPT to translate between languages, those systems rely on the same Unicode standard that makes Klingon text possible. In a way, UTF-8's inclusivity is an early step toward the "universal translators" we see in science fiction!

### What Programming Really Is

Before we dive deeper into JavaScript, it's worth understanding what programming actually means. This excellent introduction from Eloquent JavaScript provides crucial context:

[Introduction: What is Programming?](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)

**Key takeaway**: Programming is fundamentally about instructing computers to solve problems, step by step, in a language they can understand.

### Terminal Skills Reinforcement

Since you'll be using the terminal regularly in your development work, let's reinforce and expand your command line skills with this comprehensive guide:

[Basic Built-in Terminal Commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line#basic_built-in_terminal_commands)

**Focus areas**: File navigation, directory creation, file manipulation, and understanding file paths.

### How the Web Actually Works

Now that you understand how computers process information, let's explore how the web functions:

[How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/How_the_web_works)

This will help you understand the journey from typing a URL to seeing a webpage.

### How Browsers Load Websites

Finally, let's dive into the specific process of how browsers take your HTML, CSS, and (soon) JavaScript and turn them into the interactive websites users see:

## Hands-On Application

### Connecting the Dots Exercise

After reviewing all the resources above, complete this progression exercise:

1. **Binary Reflection**:
   - Write a paragraph about what surprised you most in Todd's video
   - Explain binary in your own words (pretend you're teaching a friend)

2. **Character Encoding Exploration**:
   - After watching the Computerphile video, explain the difference between ASCII and UTF-8
   - Find a webpage with international characters or emojis and explain how UTF-8 makes this possible
   - Try typing some emojis in your text editor and think about how they're being stored as numbers

3. **Terminal Practice**:
   - Try 5 new commands from the MDN terminal guide
   - Create a folder structure for organizing your learning notes
   - Document the commands you found most useful

4. **Web Journey Mapping**:
   - Draw or describe (in text) the complete journey of what happens when you type "google.com" in your browser
   - Include: DNS lookup, server communication, file transfer, browser parsing, rendering

5. **Personal Connection**:
   - Write about how this knowledge changes your perspective on the websites you've built
   - What questions do you now have about web development?

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### Why This Knowledge Matters for JavaScript

Understanding these fundamentals will help you when we start writing JavaScript because:

- **Variables** store data in computer memory (now you know what that means)
- **Functions** are instructions we give the computer (building on programming concepts)
- **DOM Manipulation** changes how the browser renders pages (now you understand the rendering process)
- **Events** respond to user interactions (which you now know trigger browser processes)

### Performance Implications

Now that you understand how browsers load websites, you can appreciate why:

- **File size matters**: Larger files take longer to download and parse
- **Code organization matters**: Browsers parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in specific orders
- **Optimization techniques exist**: Developers use various strategies to make sites load faster

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Misconceptions

**"Computers are magic"**: No - they're logical machines following precise instructions
**"The web is instant"**: Actually involves multiple steps and network communication
**"Programming is just typing code"**: It's really about problem-solving and logical thinking

### Building Mental Models

Use these analogies to remember key concepts:

- **Binary**: Like a light switch (on/off, 1/0)
- **Web requests**: Like mailing a letter and getting a response
- **Browser rendering**: Like following assembly instructions to build furniture

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### Key Takeaways

1. **Computers process everything as binary** - 1s and 0s represent all information
2. **Programming is problem-solving** - breaking complex tasks into simple instructions
3. **The web involves multiple systems** - clients, servers, networks working together
4. **Browsers are sophisticated programs** - parsing, rendering, and executing code
5. **Understanding fundamentals helps** - knowing how things work makes you a better developer
