# How Computers and the Web Work

Understanding the foundational concepts of how computers process information and how the web functions under the hood.

## Introduction

### From Clicking to Computing

**Real-world scenario**: You've been building websites with HTML and CSS, but what actually happens when someone clicks a link on your site? How does the browser know what to display? And at the deepest level, how does a computer even understand your code?

People often think of computers as complex machines, but at their core, they are built on simple principles. Understanding how computers work can help you appreciate the technology that powers our daily lives and make you a more informed developer.

We often hear things about 0s and 1s, or binary. But what does that mean? And how does that relate to the web pages you're building?

### What You'll Learn Today

- How computers actually process information (binary, processors, memory)
- What programming really means at a fundamental level
- How the web works: from URL to rendered page
- How browsers load and display websites
- The connection between these concepts and your future JavaScript work

## Core Concept Overview

### The Foundation: How Computers Think

The following video from Todd McLeod explains the concept of binary in a fun and engaging way.

### From Binary to Human Language: UTF-8 and Unicode

Now that you understand how computers work with binary (1s and 0s), you might wonder: how do computers represent the letters, symbols, and characters we use every day? How does a computer know that a certain pattern of 1s and 0s represents the letter "A" or an emoji?

**Key concepts you'll learn**:

- How computers represent text characters as numbers
- The evolution from ASCII to Unicode
- Why UTF-8 became the web standard
- How emojis and international characters work
- The connection between character encoding and web development

**Why this matters for web developers**: Maybe it doesn't on a day to day basis, but hopefully you have an appreciation for the complexity behind something as simple as typing text on a webpage. Understanding this helps you avoid common character encoding issues.

**Fun Fact:** UTF-8 even includes constructed languages like Klingon from Star Trek! This universal approach to character encoding - representing all forms of human communication, real or imagined - is actually foundational to modern AI translation systems. When you use Google Translate or ChatGPT to translate between languages, those systems rely on the same Unicode standard that makes Klingon text possible. In a way, UTF-8's inclusivity is an early step toward the "universal translators" we see in science fiction!

### What Programming Really Is

Before we dive deeper into JavaScript, it's worth understanding what programming actually means. This excellent introduction from [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) provides crucial context:

[Introduction: What is Programming?](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)

> Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating.
>
> <cite>Marijn Haverbeke</cite>

**Key takeaway**: Programming is fundamentally about instructing computers to solve problems, step by step, in a language they can understand. It can be frustrating and requires patience and persistence, just like most things worth doing well.

### How the Web Actually Works

Now that you understand how computers process information, let's explore how the web functions:

[How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards/How_the_web_works)

This will help you understand the journey from typing a URL to seeing a webpage.

### How Browsers Load Websites

Finally, let's dive into the specific process of how browsers take your HTML, CSS, and (soon) JavaScript and turn them into the interactive websites users see:

## Self-Check: Connecting the Dots

Use these prompts to check your own understanding after working through the resources above. You don’t need to submit anything here; graded work will live in BrightSpace.

1. **Binary Reflection**
   - In your own words, explain binary as if you were teaching a friend.
   - What surprised you most from Todd’s video about how computers actually work?

2. **Terminal Connection**
   - Look back at the terminal commands you’ve learned so far. How do they fit into your new mental model of “a computer running simple instructions really fast”?
   - Which commands feel the most important for everyday developer work, and why?

3. **Web Journey Mapping**
   - Without looking anything up, describe the journey from typing `google.com` in the browser to seeing the page.
   - Try to mention: DNS lookup, talking to a server, sending back files, and the browser turning those files into a page.

4. **Personal Connection**
   - How does this knowledge change the way you think about the websites you’ve built (or will build)?
   - What questions about how the web or computers work are you still curious about as we go into JavaScript?

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### Why This Knowledge Matters for JavaScript

Understanding these fundamentals will help you when we start writing JavaScript because:

- **Variables** store data in computer memory (now you know what that means)
- **Functions** are instructions we give the computer (building on programming concepts)
- **DOM Manipulation** changes how the browser renders pages (now you understand the rendering process)
- **Events** respond to user interactions (which you now know trigger browser processes)

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Misconceptions

**"Computers are magic"**: No - they're logical machines following precise instructions
**"The web is instant"**: Actually involves multiple steps and network communication
**"Programming is just typing code"**: It's really about problem-solving and logical thinking

### Building Mental Models

Use these analogies to remember key concepts:

- **Binary**: Like a light switch (on/off, 1/0)
- **Web requests**: Like mailing a letter and getting a response
- **Browser rendering**: Like following assembly instructions to build furniture

_Remember: Every professional developer started (or should have started) by learning these fundamentals. Understanding how computers and the web work gives you the context to become not just a coder, but a true developer who understands something about the systems they're building on._
