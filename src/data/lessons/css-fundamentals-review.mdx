# CSS Fundamentals Review

## Introduction

- **Icebreaker**: Look around you right now. How are the objects in your room arranged? Some things are lined up in rows, others stacked in columns, and some are positioned in grids. CSS layout works the same way!
- **Real-world scenario**: Before diving into Tailwind CSS, we need to understand what's happening under the hood. Every utility class in Tailwind maps to actual CSS properties.
- **Lesson objectives**: Review essential CSS concepts, master Flexbox and Grid layouts, and build the foundation for Tailwind success.
- **Introduction to the concept**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how HTML elements look and are arranged on the page. Think of HTML as the skeleton and CSS as the skin and muscle.

## Core Concept Overview

### CSS Selectors - Finding Elements

CSS selectors are how you **target specific elements** to style them. These exact same selectors will be crucial when you start using `querySelector()` in JavaScript and when working with Tailwind utility classes.

```css
/* Element selector - targets all h1 tags */
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

/* Class selector - targets elements with class="highlight" */
.highlight {
  background: yellow;
}

/* ID selector - targets element with id="header" */
#header {
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* Descendant selector - targets p inside div */
div p {
  margin: 1rem;
}

/* Child selector - targets direct li children of ul */
ul > li {
  list-style: none;
}

/* Attribute selector - targets inputs with specific type */
input[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid gray;
}
```

**Why this matters**: Soon you'll use these same selectors with `document.querySelector('.highlight')` and apply Tailwind classes like `class="highlight bg-yellow-200"`. Master these patterns now!

**Quick Practice**: Look at any HTML page you built previously. Can you identify:

- How to select all buttons? (`button`)
- How to select an element with class "hero"? (`.hero`)
- How to select a specific element with id "nav"? (`#nav`)
- How to select all paragraphs inside a specific div? (`.container p`)

### The Box Model - Every Element's Foundation

Every HTML element is a rectangular box with four parts:

- **Content**: The actual text or image
- **Padding**: Space inside the element, around the content
- **Border**: A line around the padding
- **Margin**: Space outside the element, pushing other elements away

Think of it like a picture frame: content is the photo, padding is the matting, border is the frame, and margin is the space between frames on a wall.

### Key Layout Properties

- `display`: How an element behaves (`block`, `inline`, `flex`, `grid`)
- `width`/`height`: Size of elements
- `margin`/`padding`: Spacing around and inside elements

## Hands-On Application

### Flexbox - One-Dimensional Layout

Flexbox is perfect for arranging items in a **single row or column**. Think of it like organizing books on a shelf.

**Basic Flexbox Container:**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Horizontal alignment */
  align-items: center; /* Vertical alignment */
  gap: 1rem; /* Space between items */
}
```

**Common Flexbox Patterns:**

```css
/* Horizontal navigation */
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

/* Centered content */
.hero {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

/* Equal-width columns */
.columns {
  display: flex;
}
.column {
  flex: 1; /* Each takes equal space */
}
```

### Grid - Two-Dimensional Layout

Grid is perfect for **complex layouts** with rows and columns. Think of it like organizing items in a spreadsheet.

**Basic Grid Container:**

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* 3 equal columns */
  grid-template-rows: auto auto; /* 2 flexible rows */
  gap: 1rem; /* Space between all items */
}
```

**Practical Grid Examples:**

```css
/* Simple card layout */
.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

/* Header-sidebar-main layout */
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main";
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
}
```

### Activity: Layout Challenge

Create these three layouts using HTML and CSS:

1. A horizontal navigation bar with evenly spaced links (Flexbox)
2. A 3-column card layout that wraps to new rows (Grid)
3. A page with header, sidebar, and main content area (Grid)

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### When to Use Flexbox vs Grid

**Use Flexbox when:**

- Arranging items in a single row or column
- You want items to grow/shrink based on content
- Creating navigation bars, button groups, or centering content

**Use Grid when:**

- Creating complex layouts with rows AND columns
- You need precise control over item placement
- Building page layouts, card grids, or form layouts

### Responsive Design Basics

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

Note the 'mobile-first' approach: start with styles for small screens, then add media queries for larger screens. So, we wouldn't usually do: `@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }`.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Layout Issues

**Problem**: Items not centering properly

```css
/* Solution: Use both justify-content and align-items */
.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

**Problem**: Grid items not filling container

```css
/* Solution: Use fr units for flexible sizing */
.grid {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* Middle column twice as wide */
}
```

**Problem**: Flexbox items wrapping unexpectedly

```css
/* Solution: Control flex-wrap behavior */
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: nowrap; /* or wrap if you want wrapping */
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Use Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts, Grid for two-dimensional
2. **Mobile-first**: Design for small screens first, then enhance for larger screens
3. **Use semantic HTML**: Choose HTML elements based on meaning, not appearance
4. **Test across devices**: What works on desktop might break on mobile

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### Key Takeaways

- **CSS selectors** help you target specific HTML elements
- **The box model** explains spacing around elements
- **Flexbox** is perfect for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns)
- **Grid** excels at two-dimensional layouts (complex arrangements)
- **Responsive design** adapts layouts to different screen sizes

### Knowledge Check

1. When would you choose Flexbox over Grid?
2. What's the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items` in Flexbox?
3. How do you create equal-width columns with Grid?
4. What's the purpose of the `gap` property?
5. How does the box model affect element spacing?

### Hands-on Assessment

**Connect Your Previous Work:** Take the semantic HTML page you created in your Gist from the previous lesson and bring it to life with CSS!

**Setup:**
1. Use the instructor-provided template repository (link will be shared in class)
2. Copy your semantic HTML content from your Gist into the template's HTML file
3. Add CSS styling to create a polished, responsive layout

**Requirements:**
- Use Flexbox for navigation, button groups, or centering content
- Use Grid for any multi-column layouts (like a skills section or image gallery)
- Make it responsive (looks good on mobile and desktop)
- Apply proper spacing using margin, padding, and gap
- Follow the linting rules provided in the template (StyleLint will help catch common CSS mistakes)

**Why This Approach:**
- You'll see how semantic HTML provides the perfect foundation for styling
- The template includes professional tooling (like StyleLint) used in real development
- This progressive enhancement approach (HTML structure first, then styling) is industry best practice

This foundation will prepare you perfectly for Tailwind CSS, where these same concepts are applied through utility classes like `flex`, `grid`, `justify-center`, and `gap-4`.
