# Git + GitHub Workflow

Connect your local Git repository to GitHub and share your work with the world.

## Introduction

### What is GitHub?

You've been tracking changes locally with Git. Your commits exist only on your computer. That's powerful, but limited.

**Technically**, you could share your project by:

1. Zipping up your entire folder (including the `.git` directory)
2. Emailing it to someone
3. They unzip it and have your complete history

This works. People did this. It's terrible.

**In real life**, we use **GitHub**.

### Git vs GitHub: What's the Difference?

**Git** = Version control tool on your computer

- Tracks changes locally
- Creates commits
- Manages history
- Works offline

**GitHub** = Cloud platform for Git repositories

- Stores your repos online
- Lets others see your code
- Enables collaboration
- Backs up your work

Think of it like:

- **Git** = Your journal where you write entries
- **GitHub** = Publishing your journal so others can read it. Or, you can keep it private on GitHub if you want.

### Why GitHub Matters

**Professional reality**:

- Every programming job expects you to use GitHub
- Portfolios live on GitHub
- Open source projects live on GitHub
- Homework submissions in this course will happen through GitHub
- Job applications typically ask for your GitHub profile

**What GitHub gives you**:

- **Backup**: Your code is safe even if your laptop dies
- **Sharing**: Send a link instead of a zip file
- **Collaboration**: Work on the same project with classmates
- **Portfolio**: Employers look at your GitHub profile

### What You'll Learn Today

- Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one)
- Connect your local Git repo to GitHub
- Push your commits to the cloud
- View your project on GitHub
- Understand the workflow for future projects

### What Success Looks Like

By the end of this lesson, your `git-practice` repository will be on GitHub. You'll be able to send someone a link to your project, and they'll see your commits, your code, and your complete Git history.

## Core Concept Overview

### The Local → Remote Workflow

```
Your Computer (Local)          GitHub (Remote)
─────────────────────          ───────────────
git init
git add
git commit
                    ─────────→ gh repo create
                    git push   (uploads commits)
```

**Local** = Your computer (what you've been doing)
**Remote** = GitHub servers (what we're adding today)

### Key Concepts

**Repository (on GitHub)**:
Your project lives in the cloud. Anyone with the link can see it (if public).

**Push**:
Uploading your local commits to GitHub. Like backing up your journal to the cloud.

**Pull**:
Downloading commits from GitHub to your computer. (We'll use this later when collaborating.)

**Remote**:
The connection between your local repo and GitHub. Git calls it `origin` by default.

### What Happens When You Push

```
Local:                Remote (GitHub):
─────                 ─────────────────
Commit 1 ────────────→ Commit 1
Commit 2 ────────────→ Commit 2
Commit 3 ────────────→ Commit 3
(new commits)         (synced!)
```

Push sends all commits GitHub doesn't have yet. Your local and remote stay in sync.

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Install GitHub CLI

We'll use GitHub's command-line tool to make this easy.

**Check if you have it**:

```bash
gh --version
```

If you see a version number, skip to Step 2.

**If you need to install it**:

**Mac**:

```bash
brew install gh
```

**Windows**:
Download from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/) and run the installer.

### Step 2: Authenticate with GitHub

Connect the GitHub CLI to your account. You probably already did this part too. You can verify by running: `gh auth status`. If the output includes: `✓ Logged in to github.com account: yourusername`, you're good to go. Skip ahead to Step 3.

```bash
gh auth login
```

You'll see prompts. Choose these answers:

1. **What account do you want to log into?** → `GitHub.com`
2. **What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?** → `HTTPS`
3. **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?** → `Yes`
4. **How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?** → `Login with a web browser`

Follow the instructions. A browser will open. Log in to GitHub and authorize the CLI.

When you see "Congratulations, you're all set!" in your terminal, you're ready.

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Existing Project

Go to the `git-practice` folder you created in the Git Fundamentals lesson:

```bash
cd ~/Dev/git-practice
```

Verify you're in a Git repository:

```bash
git status
```

You should see your branch name and commit status. If you see "not a git repository," you're in the wrong folder.

Check your commits:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You should see the commits you made earlier.

### Step 4: Create a GitHub Repository

Now we'll create the remote repository on GitHub and connect it to your local repo.

Run this command:

```bash
gh repo create
```

**Interactive prompts** will appear. Here's what to choose:

**1. What would you like to do?**
→ Choose: `Push an existing local repository to GitHub`

**2. Path to local repository**
→ Press Enter (uses current directory)

**3. Repository name**
→ Type: `git-practice` (or whatever you want to call it)

**4. Repository description**
→ Type: `My first Git project` (or leave blank and press Enter)

**5. Visibility**
→ Choose: `Public` (so you can share the link)

**6. Add a remote?**
→ Choose: `Yes`

**7. What should the new remote be called?**
→ Press Enter (uses `origin` by default)

**8. Would you like to push commits from the current branch to "origin"?**
→ Choose: `Yes`

**What just happened?**

1. Created a repo on GitHub
2. Connected your local repo to it (`origin` remote)
3. Pushed all your commits to GitHub

### Step 5: View Your Repository on GitHub

The CLI will show you a link to your repo. It looks like:

```
https://github.com/yourusername/git-practice
```

**Open that link in your browser.**

You should see:

- Your project files
- Your commit history (click "X commits" near the top)
- Your README or learning.txt file contents
- The branch name (`main`)

**Congratulations!** Your project is now on GitHub.

### Step 6: Make a Change and Push Again

Let's practice the push workflow.

**1. Make a change locally**:

Open `learning.txt` in VS Code and add a line:

```
I just pushed my first repo to GitHub!
```

Save the file.

**2. Check what changed**:

```bash
git status
git diff
```

**3. Commit the change**:

```bash
git add learning.txt
git commit -m "Add note about pushing to GitHub"
```

**4. Push to GitHub**:

```bash
git push
```

You should see output like:

```
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
...
To https://github.com/yourusername/git-practice.git
   a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  main -> main
```

**5. Refresh your GitHub page**:

Go back to your browser and refresh. You'll see:

- The commit count increased
- Your new commit message appears
- The file shows your latest changes

**This is the workflow**:

1. Make changes locally
2. `git add` and `git commit`
3. `git push`
4. Changes appear on GitHub

## Key Takeaways

### Essential Commands

```bash
gh auth login            # Connect GitHub CLI to your account (once)
gh repo create           # Create a new repo on GitHub
git push                 # Upload commits to GitHub
git remote -v            # See your GitHub connection
```

### The Daily Workflow

**On your computer**:

1. Make changes
2. `git add filename`
3. `git commit -m "message"`
4. `git push`

**On GitHub**:

- Your commits appear automatically
- Others can see your code
- You have a backup

### What You've Learned

- **Git** tracks changes locally
- **GitHub** stores your repos in the cloud
- **Push** uploads your commits
- **gh repo create** connects local to remote
- **Public repos** can be shared with anyone

## What's Next

### For the Rest of This Course

Starting with the next project, you'll work differently:

**Instead of**:

```bash
mkdir project
cd project
git init
```

**You'll do**:

```bash
gh repo clone some-repo-url
cd some-repo
```

**What's `git clone`?**
It's like downloading a project that's already on GitHub. You get:

- All the files
- Complete Git history
- Automatic connection to GitHub

Think of it like downloading, but better—you get the entire project history and can push changes back.

**Why clone instead of creating from scratch?**

- Starter code is already set up
- Dependencies are configured
- You can start coding immediately
- Team projects start this way

### The Full Circle

**What you've learned**:

1. **Git Fundamentals**: Track changes locally
2. **GitHub Workflow**: Share your work online

**What's coming**: 3. **Clone → Code → Push**: The professional workflow 4. **Collaboration**: Working with others 5. **Pull requests**: Contributing to projects

You now have the foundation every developer needs. Git + GitHub is how software gets built. Keep practicing this workflow—it becomes second nature quickly.
