# JavaScript Testing

## Pre-Work

1. Read [What is Software Testing?](https://javascript.info/testing-mocha#what-is-testing) (stop at "Mocha" section)
2. Review your recent projects where you used `console.info()` or `console.log()` to check if your code was working

## Introduction

### From Console Detective Work to Professional Testing

**Real-world scenario**: Imagine you're a chef preparing for a restaurant opening. You could taste-test each dish once and hope it works during service, OR you could create a systematic way to test every recipe consistently, document what works, and catch problems before customers arrive.

That's exactly what we've been doing with `console.info()` - we're "taste-testing" our code. But what happens when you have 50 functions? 500? How do you systematically verify that all your functions still work correctly after making changes?

### Leading Questions: Think About This

Consider the code you've been working with:

```javascript
// Your current testing approach
console.info(`Maria's percentage: ${getStudentPercentage(CIS277, maria.id)}%`);
console.info(`John's percentage: ${getStudentPercentage(CIS277, john.id)}%`);
console.info(`Class average: ${getClassAverage(CIS277)}%`);
```

**Questions to ponder**:

- What if you had 20 students to test? Would you write 20 `console.info()` lines?
- What if someone changes the `getStudentPercentage` function? How would you quickly verify it still works correctly?
- What if you're working on a team of 5 developers? How does everyone verify their changes don't break existing functionality?
- How do you remember what the "correct" output should be for each test?
- What if you need to test the same functions again tomorrow? Next week? Next month?

### What You'll Learn Today

- Why automated testing prevents 🐛s from reaching your users
- How you've already been doing "Level 0" testing with ESLint
- The evolution from manual `console.info()` to automated test suites
- Writing your first real tests with Vitest
- How tests serve as living documentation for your code

## Core Concept Overview

### The Purpose of Testing: Catching 🐛s

**Mental model**: Testing is like having a **vigilant security guard** for your code. The guard checks every visitor (function call) and makes sure they behave properly before letting them into your application.

The primary purpose of testing is simple: **catch bugs before your users do**.

```javascript
// Without tests: Users discover your bugs 😱
const calculateDiscount = (price, discountPercent) => price - discountPercent; // Bug: should multiply!
// User expects $20 off a $100 item (20% discount) but only gets $0.20 off

// With tests: You discover bugs during development 😌
const calculateDiscount = (price, discountPercent) => price - discountPercent;
// Test fails: Expected 80, got 99.80
// You fix it before shipping: price - (price * discountPercent / 100)
```

### Level 0 Testing: You're Already Testing!

**Reassurance**: You've actually been doing testing all along! ESLint is a form of **Level 0 testing** - it catches bugs that come from bad coding habits:

```javascript
// ESLint catches these bugs before they happen:
let userName = "John";
if ((userName = "Jane")) {
  // ❌ ESLint error: assignment instead of comparison
  console.log("Hello Jane");
}

// ESLint prevents:
var oldVariable; // ❌ Should use const/let
function badFunction() {} // ❌ Should use arrow functions
userName == "John"; // ❌ Should use strict equality ===
```

**Mental model**: Think of ESLint as **spell-check for code**. Just like spell-check catches typos before you send an email, ESLint catches coding mistakes before they become runtime bugs.

### A Brief History: The Evolution of JavaScript Testing

**The testing tool landscape evolved as JavaScript grew**:

1. **Jasmine (2010)**: The pioneer - introduced the `describe/it/expect` pattern
2. **Jest (2014)**: Facebook's solution - became the React ecosystem standard
3. **Vitest (2021)**: The modern choice - lightning fast, works seamlessly with modern tools

**Mental model**: Think of this evolution like **transportation progress**: horse and buggy → car → electric car. Each generation got faster and more efficient while keeping the core concept.

```javascript
// The pattern that survived across all tools:
describe("Calculator functions", () => {
  // Testing library provides "describe"
  it("should add two numbers correctly", () => {
    // "it" makes a sentence: "it should add..."
    const result = add(2, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(5); // "expect" is the assertion - what should be true
  });
});
// This reads like English: "Describe Calculator functions: it should add two numbers correctly"
```

### From Manual to Automated Testing

**Mental model**: Manual testing (your `console.info()` approach) is like **manually checking your car** before each trip. Automated testing is like having **dashboard warning lights** that constantly monitor everything.

```javascript
// Manual approach: You run this every time you want to check
console.info("Testing addition...");
console.info("2 + 3 =", add(2, 3)); // You have to remember this should be 5
console.info("Testing subtraction...");
console.info("5 - 2 =", subtract(5, 2)); // You have to remember this should be 3

// Automated approach: Computer runs and verifies automatically
it("should add numbers correctly", () => {
  expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5); // Computer knows this should be 5
});

it("should subtract numbers correctly", () => {
  expect(subtract(5, 2)).toBe(3); // Computer knows this should be 3
});
// Note: You can also use "test()" instead of "it()" - they do the same thing!
```

### The AAA Pattern: How to Structure Tests

**Mental model**: Think of writing a test like **conducting a science experiment**:

1. **Arrange**: Set up your materials (create test data)
2. **Act**: Perform the experiment (call the function you're testing)
3. **Assert**: Check the results (verify what happened matches what you expected)

```javascript
it("should calculate student percentage correctly", () => {
  // Arrange: Set up test data
  const student = {
    assignments: [
      { maxPoints: 10, pointsEarned: 9 },
      { maxPoints: 20, pointsEarned: 16 },
    ],
  };

  // Act: Execute the function being tested
  const percentage = calculateStudentPercentage(student);

  // Assert: Verify the result
  expect(percentage).toBe(83.33);
});
```

This pattern keeps your tests organized and easy to understand!

### Key Terms

- **Test**: A piece of code that verifies another piece of code works correctly
- **Test Suite**: A collection of related tests (like testing all calculator functions)
- **Assertion**: A statement about what should be true (like "result should be 5")
- **Test Runner**: The tool that executes your tests and reports results (Vitest)
- **Mock**: A fake version of something for testing purposes
- **`it()` vs `test()`**: Both do the same thing! `it()` reads more naturally ("it should add numbers"), while `test()` is more explicit. We'll prefer `it()` for readability.

## Hands-On Application

### Exercise 1: Converting Your Console Tests

Let's take your existing manual testing approach and see how it translates to proper tests:

**Your current manual approach**:

```javascript
// Manual testing - you have to run and visually verify
const maria = CIS277.students.find(({ name }) => name === "Maria");
console.info(`Maria's percentage: ${getStudentPercentage(CIS277, maria.id)}%`);
// You have to remember: "This should probably be around 85% or so..."
```

**The automated testing equivalent**:

```javascript
// Automated testing - computer verifies automatically
it("should calculate student percentage correctly", () => {
  // Create controlled test data - don't depend on external data!
  const testCourse = {
    students: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "Test Student",
        assignments: [
          { maxPoints: 10, pointsEarned: 9 }, // 90%
          { maxPoints: 20, pointsEarned: 16 }, // 80%
        ],
      },
    ],
  };

  const percentage = getStudentPercentage(testCourse, 1);

  expect(percentage).toBe(83.33); // (25/30) * 100 - we know exactly what to expect!
  expect(percentage).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(percentage).toBeLessThanOrEqual(100);
});
```

**What changed?**:

- Instead of `console.info()`, we use `expect()`
- Instead of visually checking, the computer checks automatically
- Instead of remembering what's "about right", we specify exactly what's correct
- **Most importantly**: We create our own test data instead of depending on external data that could change

**Why create test data?** In real applications, your data comes from databases or APIs (like `fetch()`). But tests should be **predictable and isolated** - they shouldn't break just because someone changes the database. We control our test data, so we control our test results.

### Exercise 2: Testing Different Scenarios

**Mental model**: Think of testing different scenarios as **quality control in manufacturing**. You test the same product with different inputs to make sure it works consistently.

```javascript
// Your current approach tests one scenario at a time
console.info("Testing normal case...");
console.info(`Class average: ${getClassAverage(CIS277)}%`);

// But what about other valid scenarios?
// What if the class has different grade distributions?
// What if students have different numbers of assignments?
```

**Automated testing makes multiple scenarios easy to test**:
```javascript
describe("getClassAverage function", () => {
  it("should calculate average for typical class", () => {
    const testClass = {
      students: [
        { assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 85 }] },
        { assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 92 }] }
      ]
    };
    const result = getClassAverage(testClass);
    expect(result).toBe(88.5); // (85 + 92) / 2
  });
  
  it("should work with perfect scores", () => {
    const perfectClass = {
      students: [
        { assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 100 }] },
        { assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 100 }] }
      ]
    };
    const result = getClassAverage(perfectClass);
    expect(result).toBe(100);
  });
  
  it("should work with multiple assignments per student", () => {
    const multiAssignmentClass = {
      students: [{
        assignments: [
          { maxPoints: 50, pointsEarned: 45 },  // 90%
          { maxPoints: 50, pointsEarned: 40 }   // 80%
        ]
      }]
    };
    const result = getClassAverage(multiAssignmentClass);
    expect(result).toBe(85); // (45+40)/(50+50) * 100
  });
});
```
```

### Exercise 3: Testing Immutability

Remember your immutability test from the manual approach:

```javascript
// Manual approach - lots of console.info statements
console.info("Adding assignment: Shows original vs new data (immutability)");
const newCourse = addAssignmentToCourse({
  course: CIS277,
  assignmentName: "Final Exam",
  maxPoints: 100,
});

console.info("Original assignments for Maria:", maria.assignments);
const newMaria = newCourse.students.find((s) => s.name === "Maria");
console.info("New assignments for Maria:", newMaria.assignments);
// You have to manually verify that original wasn't changed
```

**Automated testing approach**:

```javascript
test("addAssignmentToCourse preserves immutability", () => {
  const originalCourse = CIS277;
  const originalStudentCount = originalCourse.students.length;
  const originalFirstStudent = originalCourse.students[0];
  const originalAssignmentCount = originalFirstStudent.assignments.length;

  // Add the assignment
  const newCourse = addAssignmentToCourse({
    course: originalCourse,
    assignmentName: "Final Exam",
    maxPoints: 100,
  });

  // Verify immutability - original data unchanged
  expect(originalCourse.students.length).toBe(originalStudentCount);
  expect(originalCourse.students[0].assignments.length).toBe(
    originalAssignmentCount,
  );

  // Verify new data has the changes
  expect(newCourse.students[0].assignments.length).toBe(
    originalAssignmentCount + 1,
  );
  expect(newCourse.students[0].assignments).toContainEqual({
    name: "Final Exam",
    maxPoints: 100,
    pointsEarned: null,
  });
});
```

### Exercise 4: Writing Your First Test Suite

**Mental model**: A test suite is like a **comprehensive health checkup** for your code. Just like a doctor runs multiple tests to get a complete picture of your health.

```javascript
// Your complete test suite for student management functions
describe("Student Management Functions", () => {
  const testCourse = {
    name: "Test Course",
    students: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "Alice",
        assignments: [
          { name: "Quiz 1", maxPoints: 10, pointsEarned: 9 },
          { name: "Quiz 2", maxPoints: 10, pointsEarned: 8 },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Bob",
        assignments: [
          { name: "Quiz 1", maxPoints: 10, pointsEarned: 7 },
          { name: "Quiz 2", maxPoints: 10, pointsEarned: 9 },
        ],
      },
    ],
  };

  describe("getStudentPercentage", () => {
    test("calculates correct percentage for student with assignments", () => {
      const percentage = getStudentPercentage(testCourse, 1); // Alice
      expect(percentage).toBe(85); // 17/20 * 100
    });

    test("handles student with no assignments", () => {
      const courseWithNoAssignments = {
        ...testCourse,
        students: [{ id: 3, name: "Charlie", assignments: [] }],
      };
      const percentage = getStudentPercentage(courseWithNoAssignments, 3);
      expect(percentage).toBe(0);
    });
  });

  describe("getClassAverage", () => {
    test("calculates correct class average", () => {
      const average = getClassAverage(testCourse);
      expect(average).toBe(82.5); // (85 + 80) / 2
    });
  });
});
```

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### Testing Philosophy: What to Test vs What Not to Test

**Mental model**: Testing is like **home security**. You don't need to test every light switch, but you definitely want to test that the locks work and the alarm system functions.

**The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in Testing**: Each function should have **one job** and do it well. Your tests should verify that the function does its **one job** correctly, not that it handles everything under the sun.

- ✅ **A calculation function should be tested for**: calculating correctly with different valid inputs
- ❌ **A calculation function should NOT be tested for**: validating user input, handling network errors, or displaying error messages

**Mental model**: Think of functions like **specialists in a hospital**. The cardiologist focuses on hearts, not broken bones. Similarly, your `calculateAverage()` function should focus on math, not data validation.

```javascript
// ✅ DO test: Core business logic
test("calculateGPA computes correct weighted average", () => {
  const courses = [
    { credits: 3, grade: 4.0 }, // A in 3-credit course
    { credits: 4, grade: 3.0 }, // B in 4-credit course
  ];
  expect(calculateGPA(courses)).toBe(3.43); // (12 + 12) / 7
});

// ✅ DO test: Edge cases and error conditions
test("calculateGPA handles empty course list", () => {
  expect(calculateGPA([])).toBe(0);
});

// ❌ DON'T test: Language features or third-party libraries
test("JavaScript addition works", () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4); // Pointless - we trust JavaScript
});
```

### Test Organization: Describe, It, and Expect

**Mental model**: Test organization is like **organizing a filing cabinet**:

- `describe()` = The filing cabinet drawer (major category)
- `test()` or `it()` = Individual files (specific scenarios)
- `expect()` = The content of each file (actual verification)

```javascript
describe("User Authentication", () => {
  // The drawer
  describe("Login functionality", () => {
    // Sub-drawer
    test("allows valid user to log in", () => {
      // Individual file
      const user = { email: "test@test.com", password: "secret123" };
      const result = login(user);

      expect(result.success).toBe(true); // File content
      expect(result.token).toBeDefined();
    });

    test("rejects invalid password", () => {
      // Another file
      const user = { email: "test@test.com", password: "wrong" };
      const result = login(user);

      expect(result.success).toBe(false); // File content
      expect(result.error).toBe("Invalid password");
    });
  });
});
```

### Common Vitest Matchers (Assertion Methods)

**Mental model**: Matchers are like **different types of measuring tools** - rulers for length, scales for weight, thermometers for temperature.

```javascript
// Exact equality (like a precise ruler)
expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);

// Object/array comparison (like comparing blueprints)
expect(getUser(1)).toEqual({ id: 1, name: "John", active: true });

// Truthiness (like a yes/no question)
expect(isUserActive(1)).toBeTruthy();
expect(getDeletedUser(999)).toBeFalsy();

// Numeric comparisons (like setting limits)
expect(getStudentGrade(1)).toBeGreaterThan(0);
expect(getStudentGrade(1)).toBeLessThanOrEqual(100);

// String patterns (like spell-checking specific words)
expect(generateUsername("John Doe")).toContain("john");
expect(validateEmail("test@email.com")).toMatch(
  /^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/,
);

// Array/object content (like checking ingredients in a recipe)
expect(getStudentClasses(1)).toContain("Math 101");
expect(getStudentRecord(1)).toHaveProperty("gpa");
```

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Testing Mistakes

**The "Testing Implementation Instead of Behavior" Problem**:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Testing how it works instead of what it does
it("should use a for loop to calculate average", () => {
  // This test cares about HOW the function works internally
  const code = calculateAverage.toString();
  expect(code).toContain("for");
  // What if we change to use .reduce() instead? Test breaks!
});

// ✅ Good: Testing what the function accomplishes
it("should return correct average", () => {
  const result = calculateAverage([1, 2, 3]);
  expect(result).toBe(2); // We care about the RESULT, not HOW it's calculated
});
```

**The "Overly Complicated Test Setup" Problem**:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Too much setup makes test hard to understand
test("student grade calculation", () => {
  const mockDatabase = createMockDatabase();
  const mockEmailService = createMockEmailService();
  const mockNotificationSystem = createMockNotificationSystem();
  const complexCourseStructure = createComplexCourseWithNestedData();
  // ... 20 more lines of setup

  const result = someSimpleCalculation(2, 3);
  expect(result).toBe(5);
});

// ✅ Good: Simple, focused test
test("adds two numbers correctly", () => {
  const result = add(2, 3);
  expect(result).toBe(5);
});
```

### Best Practices for Test Writing

**1. Test Names Should Tell a Story**:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Vague test names
test("user test", () => {
  /* ... */
});
test("login", () => {
  /* ... */
});

// ✅ Good: Descriptive test names
test("should allow user with valid credentials to log in", () => {
  /* ... */
});
test("should reject login attempt with incorrect password", () => {
  /* ... */
});
test("should lock account after 3 failed login attempts", () => {
  /* ... */
});
```

**2. One Assertion Per Test** (when possible):

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Each test checks one specific behavior
test("should calculate correct percentage", () => {
  expect(calculatePercentage(85, 100)).toBe(85);
});

test("should handle zero denominator gracefully", () => {
  expect(calculatePercentage(85, 0)).toBe(0);
});
```

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### The Big Picture: Why This Matters

**Mental model**: Testing is like **having a personal assistant** who never forgets to check your work and catches mistakes you might miss when you're tired or distracted.

Benefits you gain:

- **Confidence**: Make changes without fear of breaking existing features
- **Documentation**: Tests show how your functions should work
- **Collaboration**: Team members can modify your code safely
- **Debugging**: When something breaks, tests help pinpoint exactly what's wrong

### From Console Detective to Testing Professional

**Reflection on your journey**:

- **Before**: `console.info()` statements scattered through your code, manual checking, hoping you remember what the right output should be
- **Now**: Automated test suites that run instantly, catch bugs immediately, and serve as living documentation

```javascript
// Your evolution as a developer:

// Phase 1: Hope and pray 🤞
const result = myFunction(input);
// Hope it works!

// Phase 2: Console detective work 🕵️
const result = myFunction(input);
console.info("Result:", result); // Is this right? I think so...

// Phase 3: Professional testing 🧪
test("myFunction handles typical input correctly", () => {
  const result = myFunction(input);
  expect(result).toBe(expectedOutput); // Computer verifies automatically
});
```

### Quick Mental Model Check

**Test your understanding**:

1. **Why is automated testing better than `console.info()`?**
   - It runs automatically, remembers what's correct, and catches problems immediately

2. **What's the main purpose of testing?**
   - To catch 🐛s before users encounter them

3. **How is ESLint related to testing?**
   - It's "Level 0" testing that catches bugs from bad coding habits

### HW: Convert Your Manual Tests

**Your Mission**: Take the manual testing code from your recent projects and convert it to proper automated tests.

**Part 1: Set up your first test file**

```javascript
// Create a new file: utils.test.js
import {
  getStudentPercentage,
  getClassAverage,
  addAssignmentToCourse,
} from "./utils.js";
import DATA from "./data.js";

const CIS277 = DATA[0];

describe("Student Management Functions", () => {
  // Your tests go here
});
```

**Part 2: Convert your console.info statements**
Convert these manual tests:

```javascript
// Original manual approach:
const maria = CIS277.students.find(({ name }) => name === "Maria");
console.info(`Maria's percentage: ${getStudentPercentage(CIS277, maria.id)}%`);
```

Into proper automated tests:

```javascript
test("calculates Maria's percentage correctly", () => {
  const maria = CIS277.students.find(({ name }) => name === "Maria");
  const percentage = getStudentPercentage(CIS277, maria.id);

  // Replace with actual expected value after running your manual test
  expect(percentage).toBe(/* the actual number you saw */);
});
```

**Part 3: Test different scenarios**
Remember the **Single Responsibility Principle**: your calculation functions should focus on calculating, not validating input. Write tests for the valid scenarios your functions should handle:
- Test with different numbers of students (1 student, 3 students, 10 students)
- Test with different assignment values (perfect scores, partial scores, zero scores)  
- Test with different numbers of assignments per student

**Note**: Don't test for empty arrays or invalid data - that's the job of other functions (validation functions, UI components, etc.)!
- What if assignment points are negative?

**Part 4: Fix the Buggy Functions**

🔄 **Make a Git commit** before starting this section.

Some sloppy developer used too much "vibe-coded" AI with terrible prompts and left us with buggy code! 🤦‍♂️ Your job: write tests for these functions, discover what's wrong, and fix them.

```javascript
// Add these suspicious functions to utils.js
const calculateDiscount = (price, discountPercent) => {
  return price - discountPercent;
};

const formatGrade = (percentage) => {
  if (percentage > 90) return "A";
  if (percentage > 80) return "B";
  if (percentage > 70) return "C";
  if (percentage > 60) return "D";
  return "F";
};

const isValidScore = (points, maxPoints) => {
  return points >= 0 && points < maxPoints;
};
```

Write thorough tests for each function. When your tests fail, figure out why and fix the functions!

**Part 5: Complete the Missing Functions**

🔄 **Make another Git commit** after Part 4.

The same lazy developer also left empty function stubs with tests already written. Implement the functions to make the tests pass!

```javascript
// Add these empty functions to utils.js
const generateStudentId = (firstName, lastName) => {
  // TODO: Make the test pass!
};

const calculateLetterGrade = (percentage) => {
  // TODO: Make the test pass!
};

const findTopStudent = (course) => {
  // TODO: Make the test pass!
};
```

And add these tests to your test file:

```javascript
it("should generate student ID correctly", () => {
  const id = generateStudentId("John", "Smith");
  expect(id).toMatch(/^jsmith\d{3}$/); // Pattern: jsmith + 3 digits
});

it("should calculate letter grades correctly", () => {
  expect(calculateLetterGrade(95)).toBe("A");
  expect(calculateLetterGrade(85)).toBe("B");
  expect(calculateLetterGrade(75)).toBe("C");
  expect(calculateLetterGrade(65)).toBe("D");
  expect(calculateLetterGrade(55)).toBe("F");
});

it("should find student with highest percentage", () => {
  const testCourse = {
    students: [
      { name: "Alice", assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 85 }] },
      { name: "Bob", assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 95 }] },
      { name: "Charlie", assignments: [{ maxPoints: 100, pointsEarned: 75 }] }
    ]
  };
  const topStudent = findTopStudent(testCourse);
  expect(topStudent.name).toBe("Bob");
});
```

**Part 6: Test the immutability**
Write a comprehensive test that verifies `addAssignmentToCourse` doesn't modify the original data while correctly creating new data.

🔄 **Make a final Git commit** when everything is working!

**📹 SCREENCAST REQUIREMENT**
Record a 3-5 minute screencast video showing:
1. Running your tests and demonstrating they all pass
2. Explaining what bugs you found and how you fixed them
3. Walking through your test-driven implementation process for the missing functions

This demonstrates your understanding beyond just getting the code to work!
