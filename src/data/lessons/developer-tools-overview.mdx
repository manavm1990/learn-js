# Modern Developer Tools

Overview of professional development tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Bun, and the modern web development workflow.

## Introduction

### The Developer Experience Revolution

Just a few years ago, web development meant wrestling 🤼 with complicated setup processes, inconsistent tools, and workflows that felt more like obstacles than aids. Today's modern development tools have revolutionized how we build for the web, making development faster, more reliable, and dare we say it - actually enjoyable.

### What You'll Learn Today

- The essential tools that professional developers use daily
- How these tools work together to create a seamless development workflow
- Why learning proper tooling is as important as learning to code
- How modern tools can accelerate your learning process

## Core Concept Overview

### The Holy Trinity of Web Development

As programming instructor Todd McLeod puts it: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the Holy Trinity of Web Development**. But modern web development is as much about the tools that help you work with these technologies as it is about the languages themselves.

### Essential Developer Tools

#### 1. **Git & GitHub** - Version Control & Collaboration

- **Git**: Track every change to your code, work on features safely, and never lose work again
- **GitHub**: Host your code online, collaborate with others, and showcase your projects
- **Why it matters**: Every professional development team uses version control. It's not optional.

#### 2. **Terminal/Command Line** - Direct Communication with Your Computer

- **What it is**: A text-based way to give commands to your computer
- **Built-in AI help**: Warp includes AI that can explain commands and help when you're stuck
- **Why it matters**: Many programming tasks are much faster with text commands than clicking through menus. Getting good with the terminal can actually open up additional career opportunities, but that level is beyond this course.

#### 3. **Visual Studio Code** - Your Code Editor

- **Why not Notepad or Word**: VS Code is designed specifically for writing code, especially JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- **Syntax highlighting**: Makes code easier to read and understand
- **Intelligent features**: Highlights your code with colors, suggests completions, catches typos, and provides AI 🤖 coding assistant
- **Extensions**: Add features as you need them (we'll set up the essential ones)
- **Why it matters**: A good code editor prevents many common mistakes and speeds up your work. You save your limited mental energy for solving problems, not fighting your tools.

#### 4. **Bun** - JavaScript All-in-One Toolkit

- **What you need to know now**: Bun runs JavaScript outside browsers and manages packages—17-33x faster than older tools
- **Why it matters**: Bun is the future of JavaScript development. It simplifies your workflow and makes your projects run faster. We'll cover how to use it in the next lessons.

#### 5. **Code Quality Tools**

- **ESLint**: Catches potential bugs and enforces coding standards
- **Prettier**: Automatically formats your code consistently
- **Why it matters**: Consistent, clean code is easier to debug and maintain (and grade!)

### Key Terms You Need to Know

- **Repository (Repo)**: A project folder that Git is tracking
- **Commit**: A saved snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Package**: A collection of code written by someone else that you can use in your project
- **Terminal/CLI**: Text-based interface for running commands on your computer
- **Localhost**: Your own computer acting as a web server for development

### Tool Integration Example

Let's see how these tools work together with a simple example:

**Scenario**: You're building a personal portfolio website

1. **VS Code**: You write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with syntax highlighting and error detection
2. **Development tools**: You can test your changes instantly without uploading files anywhere
3. **Code quality**: Your code is automatically formatted and checked for common mistakes
4. **Git**: You save your progress: `git commit -m "Add navigation menu"`
5. **GitHub**: You back up your code online where others can see it

### Why These Tools Matter for Learning

#### Faster Feedback Loop

- **Without tools**: Write code → Save file → Upload to server → Refresh browser → Repeat
- **With tools**: Write code → See changes instantly → Debug in real-time → Commit when ready

#### Professional Habits from Day One

- **File organization**: Proper project structure from the start
- **Version control**: Never lose work, experiment safely
- **Code quality**: Write clean, consistent code automatically
- **Collaboration ready**: Your projects can easily be shared and worked on with others

### Using AI to Learn as You Go

#### Warp's Built-in AI Assistant

One of the best features of Warp is its built-in AI that can help you learn terminal commands:

- **Ask questions**: Type `#` followed by what you want to do: "#how do I list files in a folder?"
- **Explain commands**: If you see a command you don't understand, ask Warp to explain it
- **Get suggestions**: Warp can suggest commands based on what you're trying to accomplish
- **Learn by doing**: Don't memorize commands - just ask the AI when you need help

#### VS Code AI Features

VS Code also has AI-powered features that help you learn:

- **IntelliSense**: Suggests code as you type based on what you're working on
- **Error explanations**: Hover over red underlines to see what's wrong and how to fix it
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI pair programmer that can explain code and suggest solutions. Wit a student email, you can get free access to GitHub Copilot through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

**Key principle**: Use these AI features to _learn_ and _understand_, not to avoid thinking. Always try to understand what the AI is suggesting before using it. AI is not perfect and can make mistakes. It can lead you astray and critical thinking is necessary to evaluate its suggestions.

### Setting Expectations

**Important Notes About Installation**:

- **Do not install any tools yet** - we'll do this systematically in the next lessons
- **Mac and Windows have different processes** - follow the guide for your specific operating system
- **Order matters** - installing tools in the wrong sequence can cause conflicts

### Industry Best Practices

#### Development Environment Management

1. **Keep it clean**: Don't install random tools without understanding their purposes. Preferably, consult a trusted source (e.g. boss or instructor) to verify their effectiveness. They are plenty of tools marketed as "must-haves" that add unnecessary complexity.
2. **Document your setup**: Know what you've installed and why. Fortunately, that's already done for you in this course!
3. **Use consistent naming**: Follow established conventions for files and folders
4. **Regular maintenance**: Keep tools updated, clean up unused packages
5. **Backup your work**: Use Git and GitHub to ensure your code is safe

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### Key Takeaways

1. **Modern tools are essential** - They're not "nice to have," they're professional requirements
2. **Tools work together** - The real power comes from integration, not individual tools
3. **Setup matters** - Proper installation and configuration prevents hours of frustration later
4. **Professional habits** - Learning good workflows now will serve you throughout your career
5. **Continuous learning** - New tools emerge regularly, but fundamentals remain consistent

### Create a GitHub Account and Qualify for GitHub Student Developer Pack
