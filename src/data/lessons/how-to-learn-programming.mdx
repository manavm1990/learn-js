# Welcome to SWIC Web Development

Develop the right mindset for learning to code, understand modern development tools, and build patience and persistence for your journey into professional web development.

## Introduction

Welcome to your first step towards becoming a professional web developer! In this course, you'll build on your HTML/CSS skills and learn to create dynamic web applications using JavaScript - but more importantly, you'll learn to think like a developer.

**Real-world scenario**: Imagine you're at a new job and your boss asks you to automate a tedious task that takes 3 hours every week. With programming skills, you could write a script that does it in 3 minutes. That's the power of programming - turning repetitive work into automated solutions.

This course aims to mimic real-world web development as closely as possible using the latest tools and technologies that professional developers use today. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the Holy Trinity of Web Development - you're expected to know basic HTML and CSS, but we'll build on these skills throughout the course.

### What You'll Learn Today

- How to approach learning programming with the right mindset
- How to effectively use AI tools as learning assistants
- How to ask better questions when you get stuck
- Why patience and persistence are your most important tools

## Core Concept Overview

### Programming is Problem Solving

Programming isn't about memorizing syntax - it's about breaking big problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Think of it like following a recipe:

1. **Read the whole recipe first** (understand the problem)
2. **Gather your ingredients** (identify what tools/knowledge you need)
3. **Follow steps in order** (break the problem into logical steps)
4. **Taste and adjust** (test and debug your solution)

### On Computers & Programming

> "Programming is the act of constructing a program—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating."
>
> — _Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd edition_, ch. 1

Let's unpack this in plain language:

- A **program** is just a set of **precise instructions** telling the computer exactly what to do.
- Computers are **dumb and pedantic**: they cannot "read between the lines" or guess what you meant. Sure, AI can help with that, but only if you give it clear instructions!
- Because computers only understand **explicit, formalized instructions**, programming can feel **tedious and frustrating** at first—tiny mistakes in parentheses, brackets, or punctuation can break everything. Fortunately, this gets easier with practice and with the help of AI tools.

In this course, you'll practice turning fuzzy, human ideas into clear, step‑by‑step instructions a computer can follow. Over time, you'll start to see common **patterns** for how programs process and respond to data, and the tedium will turn into power.

### Key Terms You Need to Know

- **Algorithm**: A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing errors in your code
- **Syntax**: The grammar and rules of a programming language
- **Logic**: The reasoning behind how your program should work

### The Learning Mindset

**Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset**:

- ❌ Fixed: "I'm not a math person, so I can't program"
- ✅ Growth: "I haven't learned this concept _yet_"

**Embrace the Struggle**: Getting stuck is not a sign of failure - it's a sign that you're learning something new. Every programmer, from beginners to experts, spends most of their time being confused and figuring things out.

**This is a Safe Space**: This course is designed to be a safe environment where:

- You can ask questions without judgment
- Struggling with a problem is expected and welcomed
- Your effort and learning process matter more than perfect code
- AI tools (like Warp's AI or GitHub Copilot in VS Code) are your allies in understanding concepts

Make no mistake though, programming is hard. It requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to embrace confusion as part of the learning process. Again, embrace the struggle - it's where the magic happens!

## Hands-On Application

### Using AI as a Learning Tool

#### ✅ Good Ways to Use AI:

1. **Explain concepts**: "Can you explain what a variable is in simple terms?"
2. **Debug errors**: "I'm getting this error message: [paste error]. What does it mean?"
3. **Review code**: "Can you explain what this code does line by line?"
4. **Suggest improvements**: "How could I make this code cleaner?"

#### ❌ Bad Ways to Use AI:

1. **Generate entire solutions**: "Write a program that does X for me"
2. **Skip understanding**: Using AI code without knowing how it works
3. **Replace problem-solving**: Not attempting solutions before asking AI

### The Art of Asking Good Questions

When you get stuck (and you will!), here's how to ask questions that get you helpful answers:

#### The STAR Method:

- **S**ituation: What are you trying to accomplish?
- **T**ask: What specific part isn't working?
- **A**ction: What have you already tried?
- **R**esult: What happened when you tried it?

Really, this is just a structured way of giving context so others can help you better regardless of the industry, isn't it?

#### Example:

**Bad question**: "JavaScript doesn't work, please help!"

**Good question**: "I'm trying to create a variable to store someone's name (Situation). When I run my code, nothing appears in the console (Task). I tried using `let name = John` but got an error message (Action). The error says 'John is not defined' (Result). What am I missing?"

### Building Patience and Persistence

#### The 20-Minute Rule

When you're stuck on a problem:

1. Spend 20 minutes trying to solve it yourself. Make sure that this is a **focused** effort. Not 20 minutes while looking at cat videos on YouTube and/or checking your phone every 2 minutes.
2. Take a 5-minute break (walk around, drink water)
3. Try for another 20 minutes with fresh eyes
4. If still stuck, then ask for help

This builds problem-solving muscles while preventing frustration overload.

## Learning Resources & Community

### Different Learning Styles in Programming

- **Visual Learners**: Draw diagrams of how code flows, use visual debugging tools. [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) works well for this.
- **Auditory Learners**: Explain code out loud, discuss with your peers, walk around the room by yourself and pretend that you are giving a lesson, talk to a rubber duck 🦆.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Type code yourself (don't just read). Disable the AI 🤖 and do as much as you can without it.

In reality we use a combination of all three styles, but leaning into your strengths can help solidify concepts.

### The Programming Community

Programming has an incredibly supportive community. Take advantage of:

- **Stack Overflow**: Q&A site for programming questions. Be aware that this is not always beginner friendly, and is subject general internet gatekeepers and jerks.
- **GitHub**: See how others solve problems
- **Reddit**: r/learnprogramming, r/webdev communities
- **Discord/Slack**: Real-time chat with other learners

That being said...it's social media. There are trolls and jerks everywhere. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for being a beginner. Everyone was a beginner once!

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Learning Obstacles and Solutions

#### "I Don't Know Where to Start"

- Start with the smallest possible step
- Break big goals into tiny, specific actions

#### "Everyone Else Learns Faster Than Me"

- Everyone learns at their own pace
- Focus on your progress, not others'

#### "I Keep Forgetting What I Learned"

- This is completely normal!
- Keep notes in your own words
- Practice regularly, even 15 minutes daily

### Building Learning Habits

- **Consistency over intensity**: 20-60 minutes per day beats cramming for 3 hours
- **Make it a habit**: Like going to the gym - regular practice, not marathon sessions
- **Be curious**: Ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help

### Effective Research Skills

#### Where to Look First

1. **MDN Web Docs** ([developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/)): The gold standard for web development documentation
2. **Stack Overflow**: Great for finding answers, but always verify solutions
3. **Check dates on articles**: Make sure techniques aren't outdated
4. Once you have some context and basis of understanding, then you can use AI tools to help clarify or expand on concepts. In this class, that means having a conversation with Warp's AI or GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### Key Takeaways

1. **Programming is problem-solving**, not memorizing syntax
2. **Getting stuck is normal** - it means you're learning
3. **AI tools are assistants**, not replacements for understanding
4. **Good questions get good answers** - be specific and detailed
5. **Patience and persistence** are your most valuable skills

### HW: Quiz Reflections

Review this quiz. Then, open up any text editor or note app and write down your thoughts on each question. Expound on the correct answers and reflect on your own learning process. Explain why the other answers are wrong. Add in any personal analogies or insights from your own learning journey.

These can be **rough notes** for now. In the **Learning Journal** assignment later in this module, you’ll copy/paste or refine these answers into a dedicated `week1-quiz-reflection.txt` file inside your project folder.

1. **Scenario**: You're working on your first JavaScript program and keep getting error messages. You've been stuck for 10 minutes. What should you do next?
   - a) Ask AI to write the entire program for you
   - b) Give up and try again tomorrow
   - c) Continue trying for another 10 minutes, then take a break
   - d) Immediately post on Stack Overflow asking for the complete solution

2. **Which question is most likely to get helpful responses?**
   - a) "My code is broken, please fix"
   - b) "JavaScript is stupid, why won't this work?"
   - c) "I'm trying to store a user's age in a variable, but getting 'unexpected token' error. Here's my code: `let age = 25;`. What's wrong?"
   - d) "How do I become a programmer?"

3. **True or False**: Using AI to explain error messages and concepts is cheating.

4. **Short Answer**: Describe the difference between using AI as a "tool" versus using it as a "crutch" in your own words.

### HW: Goals Reflections

For now, in the same place you wrote your quiz reflections (paper, Notes app, or a simple text file), write:

1. One paragraph about what you want to accomplish in this course.
2. One paragraph about what concerns you have (time, math anxiety, computers, etc.).

Later, the Learning Journal assignment will have you move or rewrite these paragraphs into a `week1-goals.txt` file inside your project folder.

### Next Steps

In our next lesson, we'll get your development environment set up with VS Code, Node.js, Git, and other essential tools.

Remember: **The goal isn't to never get stuck - it's to get better at getting unstuck.**
