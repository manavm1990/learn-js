# Learn Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The key benefits of using Markdown include:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use, with a straightforward syntax.
- **Readability**: Plain text files are easy to read and edit without specialized software.
- **Versatility**: Can be converted to HTML and other formats, making it ideal for web content.

You will quickly notice that this is like a light ðŸš¨ version of HTML. The difference is that this cannot be rendered directly with a browser. Instead we need a markdown renderer. In addition, the styles ðŸ’„ are generally set by the aforementioned rendered. Summarily, this is a great tool for creating structured documents without the complexity of traditional word processors or HTML/CSS ðŸ’„.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some common Markdown syntax elements:

### Headers

Use `#` for headers. The number of `#` symbols indicates the header level.

```markdown
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3
```

### Emphasis

- _Italic_: Use single asterisks or underscores.
- **Bold**: Use double asterisks or underscores.

```markdown
_Italic_ or _Italic_
**Bold** or **Bold**
```

### Lists

- **Unordered lists**: Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens.
- **Ordered lists**: Use numbers followed by periods.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2

1. First item
2. Second item
```

### Links

Create links using the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link text](URL)
```

### Images

Images are similar to links but with an exclamation mark in front:

```markdown
![Alt text](Image URL)
```

## Common Mistakes

Here are some common mistakes to avoid when using Markdown:

1. **Forgetting to close emphasis tags**: Ensure you close your italic or bold tags correctly. For example, use `_italic_` instead of `_italic`.
2. **Incorrectly formatting lists**: Be consistent with your list formatting. Mixing ordered and unordered lists can lead to confusion.
3. **Not using the correct file extension**: Always save your Markdown files with the `.md` extension to ensure proper rendering.
4. **Using unsupported syntax**: Some platforms may not support all Markdown features. Always check the platform's documentation for supported syntax.

## Conclusion

Markdown is a powerful tool for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. By mastering its syntax, you can create well-structured documents quickly and easily.

## HW: Markdown Reflection

You will now demonstrate what you have learned by creating a GitHub Markdown Gist. It's easy to do. Start by heading over to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and creating a new Gist.

<Figure

  alt="Gist MD file"
  width={966}
  height={496}
  caption="Let Gist know that is a MD file by adding a filename with a '.md' extension"
/>

**Note:** If you didn't before, you now start to realize how important file extensions are. In the case of Markdown files, using the `.md` extension is crucial for proper rendering and recognition by various tools and platforms.

From here, go back to the TXT HW reflections that you wrote previously. Rewrite them as well-formatted markdown documents, using as many of the features you learned about as possible. You can also add images if you like.

When you are done, save the Gist as shown below:

![Create Secret Gist|606x262](https://d8n3.c1.e2-8.dev/swic/save-gist.png)

Then, share the gist ðŸ”—:

<Figure
  src="https://d8n3.c1.e2-8.dev/swic/share-gist.png"
  alt="Gist MD file"
  width={614}
  height={338}
  caption="Be sure to set this to use a 'Share' link - not 'Embed!'"
/>

That ðŸ”— will be your HW submission.
