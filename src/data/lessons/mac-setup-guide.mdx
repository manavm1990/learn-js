# Mac Setup Guide

Complete setup instructions for Mac users: Homebrew, VS Code, Node.js, and Git.

## Introduction

### Welcome Mac Users!

Setting up your development environment on Mac is streamlined thanks to Homebrew, the package manager that makes installing developer tools simple and consistent. We'll get you set up with all the essential tools for web development.

**Real-world scenario**: Mac is the preferred platform for many professional developers because of its Unix-based system and excellent development tools. The setup we're doing today is similar to what you'd do at any tech company on your first day.

### What You'll Install Today

- **Homebrew**: Package manager for Mac (like an app store for developer tools)
- **Visual Studio Code**: Your code editor
- **Node.js LTS**: JavaScript runtime for running code outside browsers
- **Git**: Version control system (may already be installed)
- **Claude Desktop**: Arguably the best AI ü§ñ tool for coding

## Core Concept Overview

### What Each Tool Does

**Terminal**:

- Command line interface for interacting with your system
- Used to run commands, install software, and manage files
- We'll briefly use Mac's built-in Terminal just to bootstrap
- Then install Warp Terminal as our permanent development terminal
- Warp is superior for development work

**Homebrew**:

- Package manager for macOS
- Installs and manages developer tools from the command line
- Keeps everything updated and organized
- Like having an "App Store" for programming tools

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

- JavaScript runtime that works outside web browsers
- Includes npm (Node Package Manager) for installing libraries
- LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability

**Git**:

- Version Control System (VCS) for tracking code changes over time
- Essential for collaboration and professional development
- May already be installed on your Mac

**Claude Desktop:**

- AI assistant optimized for developers and technical work
- Includes a 'learning' mode
- Desktop app offers better performance than web version for development tasks
- Explains complex technical concepts clearly

### Understanding the Mac Terminal

The Terminal is your gateway to powerful development tools on Mac:

- **Location**: Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal
- **Purpose**: Run commands, install software, navigate files
- **Don't worry**: We'll guide you through every command. And once Warp is installed, the AI ü§ñ will be there for you üßëüèæ‚Äçüíª‚ùó

### Key Terms

- **Package Manager**: Software that installs and manages other software
- **Command Line**: Text-based interface for running programs
- **Shell**: The program that interprets your Terminal commands and communicates this to your computer
- **Path**: List of directories where the system looks for programs that we try to run from the terminal

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Bootstrap with Mac Terminal

1. **Find Terminal**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight search
   - Type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - OR: Go to Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal

2. **What you'll see**:
   - A window with white or black background
   - Text that looks like: `YourName@MacBook-Pro ~ %`
   - This is called the "prompt" - it's waiting for your commands

3. **Basic orientation**:
   - The `~` symbol means you're in your home directory. It's about `/Users/YourName`, where you would ordinarily store your personal files such as `Documents`, `Downloads`, etc.
   - You can type commands and press Enter to run them
   - Don't worry about making mistakes - we'll guide you carefully

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew will make installing everything else much easier.

1. **Check if Homebrew is already installed**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew --version`
   - Press Enter
   - If you see a version number, skip to Step 3
   - If you get "command not found", continue with installation

2. **Install Homebrew**:
   - Go to the Homebrew website: `https://brew.sh`
   - Copy the installation command (it's a long line starting with `/bin/bash`)
   - OR use this command (copy and paste exactly):

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. **Run the installation**:
   - Paste the command into Terminal
   - Press Enter
   - You'll see lots of text scrolling by - this is normal
   - When prompted for your password, type it (text won't appear as you type - this is normal for security)
   - Press Enter after typing password
   - Installation takes 5-10 minutes

4. **Follow post-installation instructions**:
   - After installation, Homebrew will show instructions like:

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```

   - Copy and paste each line separately, pressing Enter after each
   - These commands add Homebrew to your PATH

5. **Verify installation**:
   - Close Terminal and open it again
   - Type: `brew --version`
   - You should see something like "Homebrew 4.x.x"
   - If successful, move to next step!

### Step 3: Install Warp Terminal

Warp Terminal is an AI powered terminal that you will use over Mac Terminal exclusively. It will make your command line experience more efficient and user-friendly, naturally.

1. **Install Warp Terminal via Homebrew**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew install --cask warp`
   - Press Enter

2. **Open Warp Terminal**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Warp", press Enter
   - Warp Terminal should open with a Welcome screen
   - You may be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account for additional features. You should do this. Later in the lesson, we'll see how to customize some settings.

{/* TODO: Add information ‚ÑπÔ∏è connecting with GitHub account... */}

3. **Close the Standard Terminal**:
   - Make sure to close the standard Mac Terminal application to avoid confusion.
   - Warp Terminal will be your primary terminal moving forward. There is virtually no need to use the standard Terminal ever again.

**Note:** Henceforth, any references to the Terminal in this course are meant to indicate Warp Terminal.

### Step 4: Install Claude Desktop

1. **Install Claude Desktop via Homebrew**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `brew install --cask claude`
   - Press Enter
   - Wait for download and installation (2-3 minutes)

   - Claude Desktop should open with a login screen
   - Sign in with your existing Claude account or create one

3. **Verify installation**:
   - Claude Desktop should appear in your Applications folder
   - You can access it anytime via Spotlight search or Applications

4. **Claude Pro (Course Requirement)**:

   **Important**: Claude Pro is listed as a course requirement in lieu of textbook expenses.
   - **About Claude Pro**:
     - Enhanced performance and priority access during high-traffic periods
     - Increased usage limits for complex tasks
     - Access to latest Claude models

   - **Getting Claude Pro**:
     - Visit [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser
     - Sign in to your account
     - Navigate to your subscription settings
     - Choose the Pro plan for $20/mo. Feel free to go above that, but Pro is plenty for this class and it gets expensive very quickly after that tier!

### Step 5: Install Visual Studio Code

1. **Install VS Code via Homebrew**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`
   - Press Enter
   - Wait for download and installation (2-3 minutes)

2. **Open VS Code**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Visual Studio Code", press Enter
   - OR in Terminal, type: `code` and press Enter
   - VS Code should open with a Welcome screen

3. **Add VS Code to PATH** (so you can open it from Warp Terminal):
   - In VS Code, press `Cmd + Shift + P` to open Command Palette. It's a big palette of all the possible things that you would want to do
   - Type "shell command"
   - Select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
   - Click it - you should see "Shell command 'code' successfully installed"

4. **Test the installation**:
   - In Terminal, navigate to your home directory: `cd ~`
   - Type: `code .` (the dot means "current folder")
   - VS Code should open and show your home folder in the sidebar

### Step 6: Install Node.js

1. **Install Node.js LTS via Homebrew**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `brew install node`
   - Press Enter
   - Homebrew automatically installs the LTS version
   - Wait for download and installation (3-5 minutes)

2. **Verify Node.js installation**:
   - Type: `node --version`
   - You should see something like `v24.5.0`
   - Type: `npm --version`
   - You should see something like `11.5.1`
   - Both commands should show version numbers

### Step 7: Install or Update Git

Git might already be installed on your Mac, but let's make sure you have the latest version.

1. **Check current Git version**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `git --version`
   - If you see a version number, skip to Step 7 ‚è©üëáüèæ
   - If "command not found", Git isn't installed yet üòû

2. **Install Git via Homebrew**:
   - Type: `brew install git`
   - This will either install Git or update it to the latest version
   - Wait for installation to complete

3. **Verify Git installation**:
   - Type: `git --version`
   - You should see something like `git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)`

We'll configure Git and set up your name and email in the Git Fundamentals lesson.

### Step 8: Set Up Your Development directory

**Note:** A directory is nothing but a folder on your computer. We will be using the terms interchangeably.

1. **Create a Code directory**:
   - In Warp Terminal, make sure you're in your home directory: `cd ~`
   - Create the folder: `mkdir Code`
   - Navigate into it: `cd Code`

2. **Test your setup**:
   - From inside the Code folder, type: `code .`
   - VS Code should open with the Code folder in the sidebar
   - You should see "CODE" in the sidebar with an empty folder

As we work on stuff, we'll be adding directories for each assignment/project.

**\*Ô∏è‚É£ ordinarily, you should only type `code .` to open up a specific directory. We would not normally open up the entire `Code` directory in VS Code! üëéüèæ**

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### Understanding Homebrew Better

**What Homebrew does**:

- Downloads software from trusted sources. No more clicking 'Agree' in pop-ups!
- Keeps everything updated with `brew upgrade`

**Cask vs. Formula**:

- **Formula**: Command-line tools (like `git`, `node`)
- **Cask**: GUI applications (like `visual-studio-code`)
- Use `brew install` for formulas, `brew install --cask` for casks

**Useful Homebrew commands**:

```bash
brew list              # Show installed packages
brew outdated          # Show packages that can be updated
brew upgrade           # Update all packages
brew uninstall package # Remove a package
```

### File System Navigation

Essential Terminal commands for Mac:

```bash
pwd                    # Print current directory
ls                     # List files and folders
ls -la                 # List with details and hidden files
cd folder-name         # Change to folder
cd ..                  # Go up one level
cd ~                   # Go to home directory
mkdir folder-name      # Create new folder
```

### Understanding Warp Better

Warp is a modern terminal built for speed and efficiency. Here are some key features:

- **Command Palette**: Access commands quickly with `Cmd + P`.
- **Split Panes**: Work with multiple terminal sessions side by side.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Keep your terminal sessions alive even after closing the window.
- **Built-in Git Integration**: View and manage Git repositories easily.

Even better than reading this, Warp now has a Warp University and YouTube channel with tutorials and resources to help you master the terminal.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Installation Issues

#### "Command not found" after installation

- **Solution**: Close and reopen Warp Terminal
- **Reason**: Terminal needs to reload your PATH
- **Alternative**: Run `source ~/.zprofile` to reload settings

#### Permission errors during Homebrew installation

- **Don't use `sudo`** with Homebrew - it can cause problems
- **Solution**: Make sure you're running the official installation command
- **If needed**: Follow Homebrew's official troubleshooting guide

#### VS Code won't open from Terminal

- **Solution**: Reinstall the shell command:
  - Open VS Code
  - `Cmd + Shift + P` ‚Üí "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"

#### Git asking for credentials repeatedly

- **Solution**: We'll set up proper authentication in the Git lesson
- **Temporary**: This is normal for now

### Best Practices for Mac Development

#### Keep your system updated:

- **macOS**: Regularly update through System Preferences
- **Homebrew**: Run `brew update && brew upgrade` monthly
- **VS Code**: Updates automatically, but check Help ‚Üí Check for Updates

#### Organize your development environment:

```
/Users/YourName/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SWIC-Course/     (this course)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice/        (experiments)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects/        (real projects)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Desktop/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents/
```

#### Essential Mac keyboard shortcuts:

- **`Cmd + Space`** ‚Üí Spotlight search _(Find apps quickly)_
- **`Cmd + Tab`** ‚Üí Switch apps _(Navigate between VS Code and Terminal)_
- **`Cmd + C/V`** ‚Üí Copy/Paste _(Works in Terminal too)_
- **`Cmd + T`** ‚Üí New tab _(Multiple Terminal tabs)_

### Security Considerations

When you encounter Gatekeeper warnings or password prompts during installation, it's important to understand the implications. Always ensure that you are downloading software from trusted sources. If you receive a warning, double-check the URL and verify the software's authenticity before proceeding. Keeping your system secure is crucial for a smooth development experience.

**Gatekeeper warnings\*\***:\*\*

- Mac may warn about downloaded software
- For legitimate tools, click "Open Anyway" in Security Preferences
- Homebrew handles this automatically for most tools

**Password prompts**:

- Never enter your password unless you initiated the action
- Homebrew installation will ask for password - this is normal
- VS Code and Node.js shouldn't need your password
