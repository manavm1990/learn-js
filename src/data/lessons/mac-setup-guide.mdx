# Mac Setup Guide

Complete setup instructions for Mac users: Homebrew, VS Code, Bun, and Git.

## Introduction

### Welcome Mac Users!

Windows users, head over to the [Windows Setup Guide](/windows-setup-guide).

Setting up your development environment on Mac is streamlined thanks to Homebrew, the package manager that makes installing developer tools simple and consistent. We'll get you set up with all the essential tools for web development.

**Real-world scenario**: Mac is the preferred platform for many professional developers because of its Unix-based system and excellent development tools. The setup we're doing today is similar to what you'd do at any tech company on your first day.

### What You'll Install Today

- **Homebrew**: Package manager for Mac (like an app store for developer tools)
- **Warp Terminal**: Your primary terminal for this course
- **Visual Studio Code**: Your code editor
- **Bun**: All-in-one JavaScript toolkit (runtime + package manager + bundler + test runner)
- **Git**: Version control system (may already be installed)
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Command-line helper for working with GitHub and authentication

## Core Concept Overview

### What Each Tool Does

**Terminal**:

- Command line interface for interacting with your system
- Used to run commands, install software, and manage files
- We'll briefly use Mac's built-in Terminal just to bootstrap
- Then install Warp Terminal as our permanent development terminal
- Warp is superior for development work

**Homebrew**:

- Package manager for macOS
- Installs and manages developer tools from the command line
- Keeps everything updated and organized
- Like having an "App Store" for programming tools

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

- Free, powerful code editor by Microsoft
- Excellent for web development
- Thousands of extensions available. ⚠️ Be judicious about what you install. For the purposes of this course, we will install only the essential extensions.
- Built-in terminal and Git integration

**Bun**:

- All-in-one JavaScript toolkit that runs JavaScript, manages packages, bundles code, and runs tests
- 17-33x faster than npm for package installation
- Drop-in replacement for Node.js with 100% compatibility as the goal
- Modern tool used by companies like Anthropic, Midjourney, and Railway

**Git**:

- Version Control System (VCS) for tracking code changes over time
- Essential for collaboration and professional development
- May already be installed on your Mac

### Understanding the Mac Terminal

The Terminal is your gateway to powerful development tools on Mac:

- **Location**: Applications → Utilities → Terminal
- **Purpose**: Run commands, install software, navigate files
- **Don't worry**: We'll guide you through every command. And once Warp is installed, the AI 🤖 will be there for you 🧑🏾‍💻❗

### Key Terms

- **Package Manager**: Software that installs and manages other software
- **Command Line**: Text-based interface for running programs
- **Shell**: The program that interprets your Terminal commands and communicates this to your computer
- **Path**: List of directories where the system looks for programs that we try to run from the terminal

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Bootstrap with Mac Terminal

1. **Find Terminal**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight search
   - Type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - OR: Go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal

2. **What you'll see**:
   - A window with white or black background
   - Text that looks like: `YourName@MacBook-Pro ~ %`
   - This is called the "prompt" - it's waiting for your commands

3. **Basic orientation**:
   - The `~` symbol means you're in your home directory. It's about `/Users/YourName`, where you would ordinarily store your personal files such as `Documents`, `Downloads`, etc.
   - You can type commands and press Enter to run them
   - Don't worry about making mistakes - we'll guide you carefully

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew will make installing everything else much easier.

1. **Check if Homebrew is already installed**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew --version`
   - Press Enter
   - If you see a version number, skip to Step 3
   - If you get "command not found", continue with installation

2. **Install Homebrew**:
   - Go to the Homebrew website: `https://brew.sh`
   - Copy the installation command (it's a long line starting with `/bin/bash`)
   - OR use this command (copy and paste exactly):

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. **Run the installation**:
   - Paste the command into Terminal
   - Press Enter
   - You'll see lots of text scrolling by - this is normal
   - When prompted for your password, type it (text won't appear as you type - this is normal for security)
   - Press Enter after typing password
   - Installation takes 5-10 minutes

4. **Follow post-installation instructions**:
   - After installation, Homebrew will show instructions like:

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```

   - Copy and paste each line separately, pressing Enter after each
   - These commands add Homebrew to your PATH

5. **Verify installation**:
   - Close Terminal and open it again
   - Type: `brew --version`
   - You should see something like "Homebrew 4.x.x"
   - If successful, move to next step!

### Step 3: Install Warp Terminal

[Warp Terminal](https://app.warp.dev/referral/2KPYGE) is an AI powered terminal that you will use over Mac Terminal exclusively. It will make your command line experience more efficient and user-friendly, naturally.

1. **Install Warp Terminal via Homebrew**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew install --cask warp`
   - Press Enter
   - Wait for download and installation (2-3 minutes)

2. **Open Warp Terminal**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Warp", press Enter
   - Warp Terminal should open with a Welcome screen
   - When prompted to sign up for a Warp account, **choose "Continue with GitHub"** to connect your GitHub account. This gives you access to Warp's cloud features and syncs your settings across devices. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one first at github.com.

3. **Close the Standard Terminal**:
   - Make sure to close the standard Mac Terminal application to avoid confusion.
   - Warp Terminal will be your primary terminal moving forward. There is virtually no need to use the standard Terminal ever again.

**Note:** Henceforth, any references to the Terminal in this course are meant to indicate Warp Terminal.

### Step 4: Install Visual Studio Code

1. **Install VS Code via Homebrew**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`
   - Press Enter
   - Wait for download and installation (2-3 minutes)

2. **Open VS Code**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Visual Studio Code", press Enter
   - OR in Terminal, type: `code` and press Enter
   - VS Code should open with a Welcome screen

3. **Add VS Code to PATH** (so you can open it from Warp Terminal):
   - In VS Code, press `Cmd + Shift + P` to open Command Palette. It's a big palette of all the possible things that you would want to do
   - Type "shell command"
   - Select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
   - Click it - you should see "Shell command 'code' successfully installed"

4. **Test the installation**:
   - In Warp Terminal, navigate to your home directory: `cd ~`
   - Type: `code .` (the dot means "current folder")
   - VS Code should open and show your home folder in the sidebar

### Step 5: Install Bun

Bun is a modern all-in-one JavaScript toolkit that's faster than Node.js. We'll install it using Homebrew.

1. **Install Bun via Homebrew**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`
   - Press Enter
   - Wait for download and installation (2-3 minutes)

2. **Verify Bun installation**:
   - Type: `bun --version`
   - You should see something like `1.3.9` (version number may be higher)

**Optional Node.js Fallback**: If you encounter issues with Bun or need Node.js for a specific project, you can install Node.js with `brew install node` as a backup. Both Bun and Node.js can coexist on the same system, and you can use whichever works best for your needs.

### Step 6: Install or Update Git

Git might already be installed on your Mac, but let's make sure you have the latest version.

1. **Check current Git version**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `git --version`
   - If you see a version number, you can move on to the next step
   - If "command not found", Git isn't installed yet 😞

2. **Install Git via Homebrew**:
   - Type: `brew install git`
   - This will either install Git or update it to the latest version
   - Wait for installation to complete

3. **Verify Git installation**:
   - Type: `git --version`
   - You should see something like `git version 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155)`

We'll configure Git and set up your name and email in the Git Fundamentals lesson.

### Step 7: Install GitHub CLI (`gh`)

GitHub CLI makes it much easier to authenticate with GitHub and create/push repositories from the command line.

1. **Install GitHub CLI with Homebrew**:
   - In Warp Terminal, type: `brew install gh`
   - Wait for the installation to finish

2. **Verify installation**:
   - Type: `gh --version`
   - You should see something like `gh version 2.x.x`

3. **Log in to GitHub** (you can do this now or later in the Git lessons):
   - Make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged into github.com in your browser
   - In Warp Terminal, run:

   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

   - Choose **GitHub.com** → **HTTPS** → **Login with a web browser**
   - Copy/paste the one-time code and authorize in your browser
   - Back in Warp, run `gh auth status` to confirm you're logged in

You only need to do this once per machine. Later lessons will reuse this setup when pushing code to GitHub.

### Step 8: Set Up Your Development directory

**Note:** A directory is nothing but a folder on your computer. We will be using the terms interchangeably.

1. **Create a Code directory**:
   - In Warp Terminal, make sure you're in your home directory: `cd ~`
   - Create the folder: `mkdir Dev`
   - Navigate into it: `cd Dev`

2. **Test your setup**:
   - From inside the Dev folder, type: `code .`
   - VS Code should open with the Dev folder in the sidebar
   - You should see "DEV" in the sidebar with an empty folder

As we work on stuff, we'll be adding directories for each assignment/project.

**\*️⃣ ordinarily, you should only type `code .` to open up a specific directory. We would not normally open up the entire `Dev` directory in VS Code! 👎🏾**

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Installation Issues

#### "Command not found" after installation

- **Solution**: Close and reopen Warp Terminal
- **Reason**: Terminal needs to reload your PATH
- **Alternative**: Run `source ~/.zprofile` to reload settings

#### Permission errors during Homebrew installation

- **Don't use `sudo`** with Homebrew - it can cause problems
- **Solution**: Make sure you're running the official installation command
- **If needed**: Follow Homebrew's official troubleshooting guide

#### VS Code won't open from Terminal

- **Solution**: Reinstall the shell command:
  - Open VS Code
  - `Cmd + Shift + P` → "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"

#### Git asking for credentials repeatedly

- **Solution**: We'll set up proper authentication in the Git lesson
- **Temporary**: This is normal for now

### Best Practices for Mac Development

#### Keep your system updated:

- **macOS**: Regularly install system updates through System Settings.
- **Homebrew tools (Bun, Git, Warp, etc.)**: At least every 1–2 months, open Warp and run:
  ```bash
  brew update && brew upgrade
  bun upgrade
  ```
  Set a recurring reminder on your phone or calendar so this actually happens.
- **VS Code**: Updates automatically, but occasionally check **Help → Check for Updates**.

#### Essential Mac keyboard shortcuts:

- **`Cmd + Space`** → Spotlight search _(Find apps quickly)_
- **`Cmd + Tab`** → Switch apps _(Navigate between VS Code and Warp Terminal)_
- **`Cmd + C/V`** → Copy/Paste _(Works in Warp Terminal too)_
- **`Cmd + T`** → New tab _(Multiple Terminal tabs)_

### Security Considerations

**Gatekeeper warnings\*\***:\*\*

- Mac may warn about downloaded software
- For legitimate tools, click "Open Anyway" in Security Preferences
- Homebrew handles this automatically for most tools

**Password prompts**:

- Never enter your password unless you initiated the action
- Homebrew installation will ask for password - this is normal
- VS Code and Node.js shouldn't need your password
- Whenever entering your password, remember that no characters will appear as you type - this is a security feature

### Installation Checklist

Check each item as you complete it:

- [ ] Warp Terminal opens and shows a prompt
- [ ] `brew --version` shows Homebrew version
- [ ] VS Code opens and shows Welcome screen
- [ ] `code .` opens current folder in VS Code
- [ ] `bun --version` shows Bun version
- [ ] `git --version` shows Git version
- [ ] Created `~/Dev` folder
- [ ] Can navigate using basic Warp Terminal commands

### Quick Test

Run these commands in Warp Terminal to verify everything works:

```bash
# Navigate to your Dev folder
cd ~/Dev
# Check all tools are installed
brew --version
bun --version
git --version
gh --auth status

# Open VS Code from command line
code .
```
