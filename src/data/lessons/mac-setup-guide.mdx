# Mac Setup Guide

Complete setup instructions for Mac users: Homebrew, VS Code, Node.js, and Git.

## Introduction

### Welcome Mac Users!

Setting up your development environment on Mac is streamlined thanks to Homebrew, the package manager that makes installing developer tools simple and consistent. We'll get you set up with all the essential tools for web development.

**Real-world scenario**: Mac is the preferred platform for many professional developers because of its Unix-based system and excellent development tools. The setup we're doing today is similar to what you'd do at any tech company on your first day.

### What You'll Install Today
- **Homebrew**: Package manager for Mac (like an app store for developer tools)
- **Visual Studio Code**: Your code editor  
- **Node.js LTS**: JavaScript runtime for running code outside browsers
- **Git**: Version control system (may already be installed)

### Before We Start
- Make sure you have administrator access on your Mac
- You'll need your Mac password for some installations
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Set aside about 20-30 minutes for the complete setup
- Have Terminal ready (we'll walk through opening it)

## Core Concept Overview

### What Each Tool Does

**Homebrew**:
- Package manager for macOS 
- Installs and manages developer tools from the command line
- Keeps everything updated and organized
- Like having an "App Store" for programming tools

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:
- Free, powerful code editor by Microsoft
- Excellent for web development
- Thousands of extensions available
- Built-in terminal and Git integration

**Node.js**:
- JavaScript runtime that works outside web browsers
- Includes npm (Node Package Manager) for installing libraries
- LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability

**Git**:
- Version control system for tracking code changes
- Essential for collaboration and professional development
- May already be installed on your Mac

### Understanding the Mac Terminal

The Terminal is your gateway to powerful development tools on Mac:
- **Location**: Applications → Utilities → Terminal
- **Purpose**: Run commands, install software, navigate files
- **Don't worry**: We'll guide you through every command
- **Pro tip**: Mac Terminal uses bash or zsh (both work the same for our purposes)

### Key Terms
- **Package Manager**: Software that installs and manages other software
- **Command Line**: Text-based interface for running programs  
- **Shell**: The program that interprets your Terminal commands
- **PATH**: List of directories where the system looks for programs

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Open Terminal

1. **Find Terminal**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight search
   - Type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - OR: Go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal

2. **What you'll see**:
   - A window with white or black background
   - Text that looks like: `YourName@MacBook-Pro ~ %` 
   - This is called the "prompt" - it's waiting for your commands

3. **Basic orientation**:
   - The `~` symbol means you're in your home directory  
   - You can type commands and press Enter to run them
   - Don't worry about making mistakes - we'll guide you carefully

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew will make installing everything else much easier.

1. **Check if Homebrew is already installed**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew --version`
   - Press Enter
   - If you see a version number, skip to Step 3
   - If you get "command not found", continue with installation

2. **Install Homebrew**:
   - Go to the Homebrew website: `https://brew.sh`
   - Copy the installation command (it's a long line starting with `/bin/bash`)
   - OR use this command (copy and paste exactly):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. **Run the installation**:
   - Paste the command into Terminal
   - Press Enter
   - You'll see lots of text scrolling by - this is normal
   - When prompted for your password, type it (text won't appear as you type - this is normal for security)
   - Press Enter after typing password
   - Installation takes 5-10 minutes

4. **Follow post-installation instructions**:
   - After installation, Homebrew will show instructions like:
   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```
   - Copy and paste each line separately, pressing Enter after each
   - These commands add Homebrew to your PATH

5. **Verify installation**:
   - Close Terminal and open it again
   - Type: `brew --version`
   - You should see something like "Homebrew 4.x.x"
   - If successful, move to next step!

### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code

1. **Install VS Code via Homebrew**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`
   - Press Enter
   - Wait for download and installation (2-3 minutes)

2. **Open VS Code**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Visual Studio Code", press Enter
   - OR in Terminal, type: `code` and press Enter
   - VS Code should open with a Welcome screen

3. **Add VS Code to PATH** (so you can open it from Terminal):
   - In VS Code, press `Cmd + Shift + P` to open Command Palette
   - Type "shell command" 
   - Select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
   - Click it - you should see "Shell command 'code' successfully installed"

4. **Test the installation**:
   - In Terminal, navigate to your home directory: `cd ~`
   - Type: `code .` (the dot means "current folder")
   - VS Code should open and show your home folder in the sidebar

### Step 4: Install Node.js

1. **Install Node.js LTS via Homebrew**:
   - In Terminal, type: `brew install node`
   - Press Enter
   - Homebrew automatically installs the LTS version
   - Wait for download and installation (3-5 minutes)

2. **Verify Node.js installation**:
   - Type: `node --version`
   - You should see something like `v20.11.0`
   - Type: `npm --version`  
   - You should see something like `10.2.4`
   - Both commands should show version numbers

**Note**: Homebrew installs the latest stable Node.js version, which is perfect for our course.

### Step 5: Install or Update Git

Git might already be installed on your Mac, but let's make sure you have the latest version.

1. **Check current Git version**:
   - In Terminal, type: `git --version`
   - If you see a version number, note it down
   - If "command not found", Git isn't installed yet

2. **Install Git via Homebrew**:
   - Type: `brew install git`
   - This will either install Git or update it to the latest version
   - Wait for installation to complete

3. **Verify Git installation**:
   - Type: `git --version`
   - You should see something like `git version 2.42.0`

4. **Configure Git** (we'll do this properly in the Git lesson):
   - For now, just make sure the command works
   - We'll set up your name and email in the Git Fundamentals lesson

### Step 6: Set Up Your Development Folder

1. **Create a Code folder**:
   - In Terminal, make sure you're in your home directory: `cd ~`
   - Create the folder: `mkdir Code`
   - Navigate into it: `cd Code`

2. **Test your setup**:
   - From inside the Code folder, type: `code .`
   - VS Code should open with the Code folder in the sidebar
   - You should see "CODE" in the sidebar with an empty folder

3. **Create subfolder structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir SWIC-Course
   mkdir Practice  
   mkdir Projects
   ```
   - This creates organized folders for different types of work

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### Mac vs. Windows Development

| Aspect | Mac | Windows | Advantage |
|--------|-----|---------|-----------|
| Package Manager | Homebrew (essential) | Optional (Chocolatey) | Mac: Everything in one place |
| Terminal | Unix-based (powerful) | Command Prompt/PowerShell | Mac: More developer-friendly |
| Case Sensitivity | Yes | No | Mac: Teaches better habits |
| File Paths | `/Users/name/Code` | `C:\Users\name\Code` | Mac: Standard Unix paths |

### Understanding Homebrew Better

**What Homebrew does**:
- Downloads software from trusted sources
- Handles dependencies automatically  
- Keeps everything updated with `brew upgrade`
- Installs to `/opt/homebrew` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local` (Intel)

**Cask vs. Formula**:
- **Formula**: Command-line tools (like `git`, `node`)
- **Cask**: GUI applications (like `visual-studio-code`)
- Use `brew install` for formulas, `brew install --cask` for casks

**Useful Homebrew commands**:
```bash
brew list              # Show installed packages
brew outdated          # Show packages that can be updated  
brew upgrade           # Update all packages
brew uninstall package # Remove a package
```

### macOS Developer Tools

Your Mac comes with some development tools built-in:
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Includes compilers and Git
- **Terminal**: Full-featured Unix terminal
- **Text Editor**: Basic but functional
- **Safari Web Inspector**: Good for debugging web pages

### File System Navigation

Essential Terminal commands for Mac:
```bash
pwd                    # Print current directory
ls                     # List files and folders
ls -la                 # List with details and hidden files
cd folder-name         # Change to folder
cd ..                  # Go up one level
cd ~                   # Go to home directory
mkdir folder-name      # Create new folder
```

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Installation Issues

#### "Command not found" after installation
- **Solution**: Close and reopen Terminal
- **Reason**: Terminal needs to reload your PATH
- **Alternative**: Run `source ~/.zprofile` to reload settings

#### Permission errors during Homebrew installation
- **Don't use `sudo`** with Homebrew - it can cause problems
- **Solution**: Make sure you're running the official installation command
- **If needed**: Follow Homebrew's official troubleshooting guide

#### VS Code won't open from Terminal
- **Solution**: Reinstall the shell command:
  - Open VS Code
  - `Cmd + Shift + P` → "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"

#### Git asking for credentials repeatedly
- **Solution**: We'll set up proper authentication in the Git lesson
- **Temporary**: This is normal for now

### Best Practices for Mac Development

#### Keep your system updated:
- **macOS**: Regularly update through System Preferences
- **Homebrew**: Run `brew update && brew upgrade` monthly
- **VS Code**: Updates automatically, but check Help → Check for Updates

#### Organize your development environment:
```
/Users/YourName/
├── Code/
│   ├── SWIC-Course/     (this course)
│   ├── Practice/        (experiments)
│   └── Projects/        (real projects)
├── Desktop/
└── Documents/
```

#### Essential Mac keyboard shortcuts:
| Shortcut | Action | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `Cmd + Space` | Spotlight search | Find apps quickly |
| `Cmd + Tab` | Switch apps | Navigate between VS Code and Terminal |
| `Cmd + C/V` | Copy/Paste | Works in Terminal too |
| `Cmd + T` | New tab | Multiple Terminal tabs |

### Security Considerations

**Gatekeeper warnings**:
- Mac may warn about downloaded software
- For legitimate tools, click "Open Anyway" in Security Preferences
- Homebrew handles this automatically for most tools

**Password prompts**:
- Never enter your password unless you initiated the action
- Homebrew installation will ask for password - this is normal
- VS Code and Node.js shouldn't need your password

## Wrap-Up & Assessment

### Key Takeaways

1. **Homebrew is your best friend** - it makes installing developer tools easy
2. **Terminal is powerful** - don't be afraid of the command line
3. **VS Code is professional-grade** - same tool used by many companies  
4. **Node.js opens possibilities** - run JavaScript anywhere
