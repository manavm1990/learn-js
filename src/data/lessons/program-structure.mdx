# Program Structure: Variables, Types, and Operators

Learn the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript: data types, variables, and how to work with them.

## Introduction

Before you write a program, you need to understand what data is, how to store it, and how to use it. This lesson builds that foundation.

### What You'll Learn Today

- JavaScript's primitive data types: strings, numbers, booleans
- What variables are and how to create them
- The assignment operator (`=`)
- Semantic naming: making your code readable
- Template literals: combining variables and strings
- Basic operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical

### Pre-Work: Reading

Before diving into this lesson, read these specific sections from [Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 2](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html):

- **"Bindings"** — Introduction to variables and how they store values
- **"Binding Names"** — How to name variables meaningfully

These sections reinforce what you'll learn here. It should take 10-15 minutes. Stop there—don't read beyond "Binding Names" yet.

### Pre-Work: Quick Reflection

After reading, write down your answers to these questions:

1. What is a variable in JavaScript? How does it work?
2. Why is it important to choose good variable names?
3. Can you give an example of a variable declaration using `const`?

### As You Work Through This Lesson

**Keep handwritten notes**: Write down definitions of strings, numbers, and booleans in your own words as you learn them. Include 2-3 examples of each. These notes matter for the assessment.

**Experiment actively**: When you try code in the browser console, write down what you tried and what happened. Note what surprised you or confused you.

**Answer the self-check questions in writing**: Don't just think about answers—write them out with detailed explanations. One-word answers won't cut it.

### Why This Matters

Everything in a program is data. Understanding types helps you know what operations are valid, what mistakes look like, and how to think about problems systematically.

## Core Concept: Data Types

JavaScript has several **primitive data types**—basic building blocks that represent single values.

### Strings

A **string** is text. Wrap it in quotes (single, double, or backticks):

```javascript
"Hello, World!";
"JavaScript"`This is also a string`;
```

Key point: **If it's in quotes, it's a string.** Even if it looks like a number:

```javascript
"25"; // String
25; // Number
```

### Numbers

A **number** is any numeric value without quotes:

```javascript
42;
3.14 - 7;
0;
2.998e8; // Scientific notation
```

JavaScript doesn't distinguish between integers and decimals. They're all just `number` type.

**Edge cases:**

```javascript
Infinity - // A valid number (result of 1/0)
  Infinity; // Negative infinity
NaN; // "Not a Number" (but it's actually type number—confusing!)
```

If you see `NaN`, something went wrong with a calculation.

### Booleans

A **boolean** is one of two values: `true` or `false`. No quotes.

```javascript
true;
false;
```

**Not a boolean:**

```javascript
"true"; // String
"false"; // String
```

Booleans are used to make decisions: "Is this condition true? Then do this."

### Empty Values

JavaScript has two special values that mean "nothing":

**`undefined`** — The variable exists but has no value assigned yet.

```javascript
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
```

**`null`** — Intentional assignment of "nothing."

```javascript
let y = null; // Deliberately saying "this is nothing"
```

**For now, just know they exist.** You'll rarely use them deliberately.

## Creating Variables: `const` and `let`

A **variable** is a named storage location. You create one with `const` or `let`:

```javascript
const name = "Alex";
const age = 25;
const isStudent = true;
```

### `const` vs `let`

**Use `const` by default.** It means "this variable won't be reassigned."

```javascript
const favoriteColor = "blue"; // ✅ Perfect
```

**Use `let` only if you'll change the value later.**

```javascript
let counter = 0;
counter = counter + 1; // ✅ Changed, so `let` is correct
```

**Don't use `var`.** It's old syntax. Forget it exists.

---

## The Assignment Operator: `=`

**`=` does NOT mean "equals."** It means "store the value on the right into the variable on the left."

```javascript
const x = 5; // Store 5 in x
const y = x; // Store the VALUE of x (which is 5) in y

console.log(x); // 5
console.log(y); // 5
```

Later, you'll see `===` (triple equals), which means "are these values equal?"

```javascript
console.log(5 === 5); // true
console.log(5 === "5"); // false (different types)
```

---

## Semantic Naming: Write Readable Code

**Bad variable names:**

```javascript
const x = "Alex";
const y = 25;
const z = true;
```

You have no idea what these are.

**Good variable names:**

```javascript
const userName = "Alex";
const userAge = 25;
const isStudent = true;
```

Now it's obvious. This is **semantic naming**—names describe what they contain.

### Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase`: first word lowercase, next words capitalized
  - `userName`, `isStudent`, `totalCost`, `hasPermission`
- Be specific: `userName` is better than `user`
- For booleans, start with `is` or `has`: `isActive`, `hasPermission`
- Avoid single letters except in loops (later)

## Basic Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```javascript
5 + 3; // 8 (addition)
5 - 3; // 2 (subtraction)
5 * 3; // 15 (multiplication)
5 / 3; // 1.666... (division)
5 % 3; // 2 (modulus—remainder)
```

**Modulus (`%`)** is useful for checking if something is even or odd:

```javascript
5 % 2; // 1 (odd)
4 % 2; // 0 (even)
```

### Comparison Operators

These return `true` or `false`:

```javascript
5 === 5; // true (strict equal—same value, same type)
5 === "5"; // false (different types)
5 !== 5; // false (strict not equal)
5 > 3; // true
5 < 3; // false
5 >= 5; // true
5 <= 3; // false
```

**Always use `===` and `!==`.** Never use `==` or `!=` (they have weird behavior).

### Logical Operators

These combine boolean values:

```javascript
true && true; // true (AND—both must be true)
true && false; // false
true || false; // true (OR—at least one must be true)
false || false; // false
!true; // false (NOT—reverses the value)
!false; // true
```

## Template Literals: Combine Strings and Variables

You can insert variables into strings using backticks and `${}`:

```javascript
const name = "Alex";
const age = 25;

console.log(`My name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
```

Output:

```
My name is Alex and I'm 25 years old.
```

**Inside `${}`, you can use expressions:**

```javascript
const x = 5;
const y = 3;

console.log(`${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`); // 5 + 3 = 8
```

**Old way (don't do this):**

```javascript
console.log("My name is " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
```

Template literals are cleaner and more readable.

## Type Coercion: When JavaScript Changes Types

JavaScript is **dynamically typed**, meaning it tries to make sense of operations even when types don't match:

```javascript
"5" + 5; // "55" (string concatenation—"5" forces addition to concat)
"5" * 2; // 10 (numeric multiplication—2 forces coercion to number)
"5" - 2; // 3 (subtraction requires numbers)
true + 1; // 2 (true is treated as 1)
false + 1; // 1 (false is treated as 0)
```

**Key takeaway:** `+` with strings concatenates. Other operators coerce to numbers.

If something unexpected happens, type coercion might be the culprit.

## Hands-On: Explore in Your Browser Console

### What's the Browser Console?

You've used DevTools to inspect HTML and CSS. The **Console tab** is different—it's a **complete JavaScript runtime** built into your browser. You can type JavaScript directly and see results instantly.

The console is a **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print-Loop):

- **Read** your code
- **Evaluate** it (run it)
- **Print** the result
- **Loop** (wait for the next line)

You'll see REPLs in many languages and tools. It's just a way to type code and get instant feedback.

Why use it?

- **Quick experimentation**: Try code ideas without creating files
- **Immediate feedback**: Type, press Enter, see output
- **No setup needed**: Works in any browser, right now
- **Perfect for learning**: Test concepts before writing real programs

### Getting to the Console

1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
2. Press **F12** (or right-click → "Inspect")
3. Click the **Console** tab (you'll see a `>` prompt)
4. Start typing JavaScript

### Try These Examples

Type each line, press Enter, and see the result:

#### Strings

```javascript
"Hello";
"Hello" + " " + "World"`Hello ${"World"}`;
("5");
```

#### Numbers

```javascript
5;
5 + 3;
10 / 3;
10 % 3;
NaN;
```

#### Booleans

```javascript
true;
false;
5 > 3;
5 === 5;
5 === "5";
```

#### Variables

```javascript
const name = "Alex";
const age = 25;
name;
age`${name} is ${age} years old`;
```

#### Type Coercion

```javascript
"5" + 5;
5 + 5;
"5" * 2;
true + 1;
```

**Experiment.** Try combinations that surprise you. Break things. That's how you learn what's valid.

**Using Warp to Learn:** If you get confused about why something works the way it does, open Warp and use the AI (type `#` followed by your question). Ask "Why does `"5" + 5` equal `"55"`?" and let the AI explain it.

If you still have questions, ask the class in Teams or reach out to the instructor directly. Don't get stuck—that's what we're here for.

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting Quotes on Strings

```javascript
const name = Alex; // ❌ Error—JS looks for a variable named Alex
const name = "Alex"; // ✅ Correct
```

### Mixing Up `=` and `===`

```javascript
const x = 5; // ✅ Assignment
5 === 5; // ✅ Comparison (returns true)
if ((x = 5)) {
} // ❌ Assigns 5 to x (probably not what you meant)
if (x === 5) {
} // ✅ Compares x to 5
```

### Using `==` Instead of `===`

```javascript
5 == "5"; // true (weird—avoids type checking)
5 === "5"; // false (correct—checks type too)
```

Always use `===`.

### Treating Strings Like Numbers

```javascript
"5" + 5; // "55" (concatenation, not addition)
Number("5") + 5; // 10 (explicitly convert to number first)
```

### Forgetting `const` or `let`

```javascript
x = 5; // ❌ Creates a global variable (bad)
const x = 5; // ✅ Correct
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Primitives**: strings (text), numbers (math), booleans (true/false)
- **Variables**: use `const` by default, `let` only if reassigning
- **Assignment (`=`)**: stores value on right into variable on left
- **Comparison (`===`)**: checks if values are equal
- **Semantic naming**: make variable names describe their content
- **Template literals**: use backticks and `${}` to combine strings and variables
- **Type coercion**: JS tries to make sense of mixed types (be careful)

## Self-Check: Do You Understand?

Try answering these without looking back:

1. What's the difference between `"5"` and `5`?
2. When would you use `let` instead of `const`?
3. What does `===` do? How is it different from `=`?
4. Write a template literal that combines two variables into a sentence.
5. What does `5 % 2` return, and why is that useful?
6. What's the difference between `5 + 3` and `"5" + 3`? Why?
7. Why is semantic naming important?

If you can answer these, you're ready for the next lesson where you'll actually write and run code.
