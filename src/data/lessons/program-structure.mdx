# Program Structure & Variables in JavaScript

## Pre-Work

1. Read [Program Structure](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html) until you get to _Conditional execution._
1. Read [Variables](https://javascript.info/variables). Be sure to work through and understand the _Tasks._
1. Read [Data Types](https://javascript.info/types). This should be mostly a review.

## Introduction

- Icebreaker: What do you think a variable is in programming?
- Real-world scenario: Think of a variable as an 🐙 using its arms to bind itself to values.
- Lesson objectives: Learn about variables, their types, and how to use them in JavaScript.
- Introduction to the concept: Variables are fundamental in programming, allowing us to store and manipulate data.

## Expressions and Statements

In JavaScript, a **statement** is a complete instruction that performs an action. For example, declaring a variable or calling a function are statements. Statements can be simple or complex, and they often end with a semicolon (`;`), although JavaScript can usually infer the end of a statement without it.

An expression is a sentence fragment while a statement is a complete sentence. An expression produces a value, while a statement performs an action. A statement usually does something more meaningful, like creating a variable, calling a function, or controlling the flow of the program.

`5 + 3;` is an expression that evaluates to `8`, but `const sum = 5 + 3;` is a statement that declares a variable `sum` and assigns it the value of the expression `5 + 3`. In the former, nothing is done with the value `8`, it's created and then discarded or garbage collected. In the latter, the value `8` is stored in the variable `sum` for later use. A statement typically has consequences and repercussions in the program, while an expression simply produces a value.

## Variable Bindings

A **variable** is a reference to a value stored in the computer's memory.

From _Eloquent JavaScript's_ apt analogy, values float around in a sea of data, and variables are an 🐙 octopus' tentacles grasping at these values, creating variable bindings.

The analogy takes it a step further by mentioning variable names being tattooed onto these tentacles, representing variable names.

Variables declared with the keyword `const` (which is what we should be doing 99% of the time) cannot be reassigned. In this case, the 🐙 tentacle will forever clutch this same value, never releasing it as long as it's alive.

This 🐙 analogy is actually a much more accurate mental model than others where variables are described as boxes storing values, or similar 👎🏾.

## `console.log()`

This may not have much meaning at the moment, but we will repeat this mantra throughout the course, "Everything in JavaScript is an object, except for primitives. And even those can be treated like objects sometimes."

JavaScript has many built in objects, all of which extend from the base prototype `Object`. One of the most commonly used built-in objects is `console`, which provides access to the browser's debugging console (or the terminal console when using Node.js).

Both the browser dev console and Node.js provide this built in object called `console`. And, just like any other object, we use **dot notation** to access its properties and methods.

Properties are just values associated with the object, while methods are functions that belong to the object. Properties describe an object while methods perform actions.

In the case of the `console` object, we don't much care about its properties, we just want to do things with it. The most commonly used method of the `console` object is `log()`, which outputs messages to the console by accepting one or more **arguments.**

An argument is just a value you pass into a function whenever you call it. Here, arguments are good things. They provide the information ℹ️ that a function/method needs to do its job. `console.log()` can take multiple arguments, separated by commas. Each argument can be a string, number, boolean, variable, or even an expression.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); // Logs a string
console.log(42); // Logs a number
console.log(true); // Logs a boolean
const name = "Alice";
console.log("User name is:", name); // Logs a string and a variable
console.log("Sum of 5 + 3 is:", 5 + 3); // Logs a string and an expression
```

**Note for Java/C# learners** JS is an OOP language like those others, but it's more than that. It also supports functional and procedural programming styles. Those other languages have been adopting more functional features over time, but JS has always had them. Furthermore, JS uses prototypal inheritance rather than class-based inheritance, which is a key difference.

## Browser Function/Methods

The readings reference `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()` functions that are built into web browsers. These functions create pop-up dialog boxes that interact with the user. These would only work in the browser environment, not in Node.js.

All of these functions are methods of the `window` object. Since JS is just a mere programming language, it doesn't know about the web browser, but it does understand objects very well. Therefore, the ever graceful web browser offers up to JS all of its functionality packaged into a single giant global object called `window`.

True functions, as we will learn later, are not tied to any object. They stand alone. Methods, on the other hand, are functions that belong to an object and must be accessed via `.` notation, with the exception of global objects such as `window`.

## Hands-On Application

### Step 1: Open the Browser Console

For these exercises, we'll use the browser's developer console - a built-in tool that lets you write and test JavaScript immediately without creating files.

**"Wait, didn't we set up VS Code?"** Yes! We'll use VS Code extensively in upcoming lessons. For now, we're starting with the console because:

- **Immediate feedback** - see results instantly without running files
- **Focus on concepts** - no file management distractions
- **Professional skill** - developers use console constantly for testing ideas
- **Perfect for basics** - simple variables and operations don't need file complexity

1. **Open your web browser** (Preferably Chrome or FF Developer Edition for best experience)
2. **Open the developer console**:
   - **Chrome**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - **Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac)
3. **Find the Console tab** - click on it if it's not already selected
4. **You should see a prompt** (usually `>`) where you can type JavaScript code

### Step 2: Your First JavaScript Code

1. **Type this in the console** and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```
2. **Try another line**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("I'm learning JavaScript!");
   ```

3. **You should see the output** appear immediately in the console!

You will also see `undefined` after each `console.log()` call because the method itself does not return a value. The purpose of `console.log()` is to display information in the console, not to produce a value that can be used elsewhere.

This console environment will always output the result of the last expression evaluated, which is `undefined` for `console.log()`. ;)

**Pro tip**: You can press the ↑ (up arrow) key to repeat previous commands.

### Console Workflow Tips

**For longer code blocks**: Instead of typing line by line, you can:

1. **Use Shift+Enter** to create multiple lines without executing
2. **Copy and paste** entire code blocks at once
3. **Type in any text editor first**, then copy to console if needed

**Common console quirks**:

- **Variables disappear**: If you refresh the page, all your variables are lost - this is normal!
- **Autocomplete suggestions**: Console might suggest variables from the website - just ignore these
- **Red error messages**: Totally normal when learning - read them for helpful clues
- **Long outputs get cut off**: Click the expand arrows to see more

**Remember**: Making mistakes is how we learn! Every programmer, including your instructor, makes typos and errors daily. The console is a safe space to experiment, break things, and try again. 🧪

**Pro workflow**: Keep your console open in a **blank tab** (about:blank or new tab) to avoid interference from website code. If the console becomes cumbersome, that's normal - we'll introduce file-based coding in upcoming lessons when projects get more complex!

### Step 3: Working with Variables

Variables let you store and reuse information. Let's practice in the browser console!

**First, let's learn about comments**: Comments are notes you can add to your code to explain what it does. They start with `//` and JavaScript completely ignores them. Comments help you (and others) understand your code later.

```javascript
// This is a comment - it explains what the code does
const age = 25; // You can also put comments at the end of a line
```

Comments are like sticky notes for your code - use them to remind yourself what you were thinking!

1. **In the console, type each line and press Enter**:

   ```javascript
   // This is a comment - it explains what the code does
   // Comments start with // and are ignored by JavaScript
   
   // Creating variables with const (default choice)
   const firstName = "Alex";
   ```

2. **Continue with more variables**:

   ```javascript
   const age = 25;
   const isStudent = true;
   ```

3. **Display the variables**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("First Name:", firstName);
   console.log("Age:", age);
   console.log("Is Student:", isStudent);
   ```

4. **You should see the output** appear as you type each line!

**Note**: You can type multiple lines at once by holding Shift and pressing Enter to go to a new line without executing.

### Step 4: Variable Types Challenge

**Quick Challenge: Your Personal Data**

1. **Create 4 variables about yourself**:

   ```javascript
   const myName = "Your actual name";
   const myAge = 20; // Your real age
   const isStudent = true; // Are you a student?
   const favoriteNumber = 7; // Pick any number
   ```

2. **Test the types**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Name type:", typeof myName);
   console.log("Age type:", typeof myAge);
   console.log("Student type:", typeof isStudent);
   console.log("Number type:", typeof favoriteNumber);
   ```

3. **Display your data**:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hi, I'm", myName, "and I'm", myAge, "years old!");
   ```

**That's it!** You understand data types when you can predict what `typeof` will return.

### Step 5: Basic Operations Practice

**Practice with Your Numbers**

1. **Math with your data**:

   ```javascript
   const num1 = 10; // Use your age or any meaningful number
   const num2 = 5; // Use another number that matters to you

   const sum = num1 + num2;
   const product = num1 * num2;

   console.log(num1, "+", num2, "=", sum);
   console.log(num1, "*", num2, "=", product);
   ```

2. **Combine strings**:

   ```javascript
   const firstName = "Your name";
   const lastName = "Your last name";
   const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

   console.log("Full name:", fullName);
   ```

3. **When values change** (this is when we use `let`):

   ```javascript
   let counter = 0;
   console.log("Start:", counter);

   counter = counter + 5;
   console.log("After adding 5:", counter);
   ```

**Template Literal Challenge**: Try rewriting the string combination using backticks and `${}` instead of `+`!

### Step 6: Put It All Together

**Simple About Me Program**

Combine what you've learned into one small program:

```javascript
// Your basic info
const name = "Your name here";
const age = 20; // Your actual age
const city = "Your city";
const isLearningJS = true;

// Display your info
console.log("=== About Me ===");
console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("City:", city);
console.log("Learning JavaScript:", isLearningJS);

// One calculation
const yearsTo30 = 30 - age;
console.log("Years until 30:", yearsTo30);
```

**Your turn**:

1. Replace the placeholder values with your real information
2. Try rewriting one of the console.log statements using template literals
3. Add one more piece of information about yourself

**That's it!** You've created a JavaScript program using variables, data types, and operations.

## Advanced Concepts & Comparisons

### let, const, and var: Variable Declaration Keywords

**Important note about the pre-work readings**: You'll notice the JavaScript.info article starts examples with `let`. This was written when `const` wasn't as widely adopted. In 2025, modern development practices have evolved!

| Keyword | When to Use                         | Can Change Value? | Example                   | 2025 Status                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `const` | **DEFAULT CHOICE** - Most variables | ❌ No             | `const name = "Alex";`    | ✅ **Modern standard**          |
| `let`   | Only when value will change         | ✅ Yes            | `let age = 25; age = 26;` | ✅ When needed                  |
| `var`   | Never                               | ✅ Yes            | `var count = 0;`          | ❌ **It's 2025. Don't use it!** |

**Modern best practice**: Use `const` by default, `let` only when you need to reassign the variable, never `var`.

**Why `const` by default?**

- **Prevents accidental changes** - catches bugs before they happen
- **Communicates intent** - makes it clear the value shouldn't change
- **Team standards** - most modern codebases and linters enforce this
- **Functional programming influence** - immutability is preferred when possible

**Note**: Different teams may have varying standards, but `const`-by-default is increasingly the norm at modern companies.

```javascript
// Good examples
const PI = 3.14159; // Never changes
const userName = "alex2024"; // Won't change in this program
let score = 0; // Will change as game progresses
let currentLevel = 1; // Will increase over time

// This would cause an error:
// PI = 3.14;  // Can't change const variables!
```

### String Operations and Template Literals

**Traditional string combination**:

```javascript
let name = "Sarah";
let age = 28;
let message = "Hi, I'm " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.";
```

**Modern template literals** (easier!):

```javascript
let name = "Sarah";
let age = 28;
let message = `Hi, I'm ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`;
```

Template literals use backticks (`) and `${}` for variables.

### Numbers and Math Operations

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 3;

console.log("Addition:", a + b); // 13
console.log("Subtraction:", a - b); // 7
console.log("Multiplication:", a * b); // 30
console.log("Division:", a / b); // 3.333...
console.log("Remainder:", a % b); // 1

// Built-in Math functions
console.log("Square root of 16:", Math.sqrt(16)); // 4
console.log("Random number:", Math.random()); // 0.something
console.log("Round 3.7:", Math.round(3.7)); // 4
```

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Beginner Errors

#### "SyntaxError: Unexpected token"

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong - missing quotes
const name = Alex;

// ✅ Correct - strings need quotes
const name = "Alex";
```

#### "ReferenceError: variable is not defined"

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong - typo in variable name
const firstName = "John";
console.log(firstname); // lowercase 'f'

// ✅ Correct - exact spelling matters
const firstName = "John";
console.log(firstName);
```

#### "Uncaught SyntaxError" in browser console

- **Solution**: Check your syntax - missing quotes, brackets, or semicolons
- **Tip**: The browser will show you the line where the error occurred
- **Common fix**: Make sure all strings are wrapped in quotes

### JavaScript Best Practices

#### Naming conventions:

```javascript
// ✅ Good variable names (camelCase)
const firstName = "John";
const userAge = 25;
const isLoggedIn = true;
const bankAccountBalance = 1500.75;

// ❌ Avoid these naming styles
const first_name = "John"; // snake_case (Python style)
const UserAge = 25; // PascalCase (for classes only)
const x = true; // Not descriptive
const a1b2c3 = 1500.75; // Meaningless
```

#### Code organization:

```javascript
// Group related variables together
const userName = "alex2024";
const userEmail = "alex@email.com";
const userAge = 22;

// Add blank lines between different sections
const gameScore = 0;
const gameLevel = 1;
const gameLives = 3;

// Use comments to explain what sections do
// === Player Statistics ===
console.log("Player:", userName);
console.log("Score:", gameScore);
```

#### Console.log() tips:

```javascript
// ✅ Descriptive output
console.log("User name:", userName);
console.log("Current score:", gameScore);

// ❌ Hard to understand output
console.log(userName);
console.log(gameScore);

// ✅ Use multiple values in one log
console.log("Game status:", gameLevel, gameScore, gameLives);
```

### Browser Console Tips

**Useful console shortcuts**:

- **↑/↓ arrow keys**: Navigate through command history
- **Tab**: Auto-complete variable names and functions
- **Ctrl/Cmd + L**: Clear the console screen
- **Shift + Enter**: Create multi-line input without executing
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + J**: Open console directly (Chrome)

**Console features**:

- **Variable inspection**: Just type a variable name and press Enter to see its value
- **Error highlighting**: Syntax errors are highlighted in red
- **Auto-complete**: Console suggests completions as you type
- **History**: Your commands are saved for the session

console.log(text, number, truth);

// Operations
const sum = 5 + 3; // 8
const difference = 10 - 4; // 6
const product = 6 * 7; // 42
const quotient = 15 / 3; // 5
const remainder = 17 % 5; // 2

// String concatenation
const full = "Hello" + " " + "World"; // "Hello World"
const modern = `Hello ${text}`; // Template literal

// Use ↑/↓ keys to navigate history
```

### Quick Assessment

**Test your understanding:**

1. **What's the difference between `let` and `const`?**
   - Answer: `const` prevents reassignment (use by default), `let` allows reassignment (use when needed)

2. **How do you execute JavaScript code in the browser?**
   - Answer: Open developer console and type code, then press Enter

3. **Which is correct for storing text?**
   - a) `const name = Alex;`

### HW: Pre-Work Reflection

**Submit as a separate Markdown (.md) file addressing these questions:**

1. **How did the pre-work readings help you?** Did reading about program structure and variables before the hands-on practice make the concepts clearer? What connections did you make between the reading and the console exercises?

2. **Building on previous knowledge**: We covered values, types, and operators in the previous lesson. How did today's focus on variables and program structure build on what you already learned? What felt familiar vs. new?

3. **If you're taking other programming classes**: Was there anything surprising about JavaScript compared to other languages you've encountered? How does JavaScript's approach to variables and types compare to what you've seen elsewhere?

4. **If this is your first programming experience**: How are you feeling about programming so far? What aspects feel natural and which feel challenging? Are you starting to see how these basic building blocks (values, types, operators, variables) work together?

5. **The octopus analogy**: Eloquent JavaScript uses the tentacle/binding analogy for variables. Did this mental model help you understand how variables work? Do you have your own way of thinking about variables?

**Note**: This helps us understand your learning process and adjust future lessons accordingly.

### Next Steps

With JavaScript basics mastered, you're ready to:

1. **Complete practice exercises** and homework assignments
2. **Learn functions** for organizing and reusing code
3. **Build interactive programs** that respond to user input
4. **Explore web development** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Congratulations!** You've written your first JavaScript programs and understand the fundamental building blocks of programming.
