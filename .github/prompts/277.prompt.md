The audience for this lesson are learners in the second part of the course. They are preparing for React development and have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and web development concepts. They need a 'quick review' of modern JavaScript features, including arrow functions, destructuring, and modules, to ensure they are comfortable with the syntax and concepts before diving into React.

Include real-world technical interview questions as part of the HW for each lesson. Either a couple assigned, or a list and they can pick a couple.

## JavaScript Coding Standards for This Course

**MANDATORY**: All JavaScript code examples in lessons MUST follow these standards (based on course linting rules):

**Variable Declarations & Modern JavaScript**:
- **Always use `const` instead of `let`**: Use `const` for all variable declarations unless reassignment is absolutely necessary
- **Prefer arrow functions**: Use `() => {}` syntax for cleaner, modern code
- **Use template literals**: Use backticks for string interpolation instead of concatenation
- **Strict equality**: Always use `===` instead of `==`

**Function Design (React Preparation)**:
- **Single responsibility**: Each function should do one clear thing (prepares for React components)
- **Keep functions short**: Aim for functions under 15 lines (excluding comments)
- **Limit parameters**: Maximum 3-4 parameters per function
- **Use descriptive names**: Function and variable names should be self-explanatory
- **Early returns**: Avoid `else` after `return` statements

**Immutability & Best Practices** (Critical for React):
- **No parameter mutation**: Don't modify function parameters
- **Prefer immutable operations**: Use array methods like `map`, `filter` instead of loops
- **One variable per declaration**: Avoid `let a, b, c;` style declarations
- **Consistent returns**: Functions should always return a value or never return

These standards reinforce functional programming concepts essential for React development and prepare students for modern JavaScript patterns.
