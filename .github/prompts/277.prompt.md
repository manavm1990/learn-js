The audience for this lesson are learners in the second part of the course. They are preparing for React development and have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and web development concepts. They need a 'quick review' of modern JavaScript features, including arrow functions, destructuring, and modules, to ensure they are comfortable with the syntax and concepts before diving into React.

Include real-world technical interview questions as part of the HW for each lesson. Either a couple assigned, or a list and they can pick a couple.

## JavaScript Coding Standards for This Course

**MANDATORY**: All JavaScript code examples in lessons MUST use `const` instead of `let`:

- Use `const` for all variable declarations unless reassignment is explicitly needed
- Promote immutable programming patterns appropriate for React development
- Demonstrate modern JavaScript best practices that prepare students for React
- Only use `let` when variable reassignment cannot be avoided

This standard reinforces functional programming concepts essential for React development.
