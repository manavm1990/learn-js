# Project Overview

This project is a modern web development course for a community college. The audience is primarily students who are new to web development. They have been exposed to HTML and CSS but have never done any real programming.

This course builds core client-side programming skills using JavaScript. Students will learn to manipulate the DOM, handle events, use control structures, and work with strings, objects, cookies, and browser storage. Emphasis is placed on writing interactive, efficient code and exploring advanced functions.

The course continues on into React and NextJS.

**Lesson Timing**: Design lessons to take approximately 2 hours total (including any pre-work reading). Consider the pace appropriate for community college students new to programming.
